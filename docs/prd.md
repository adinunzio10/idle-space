# Overview  
The Signal Garden is an idle/incremental mobile game where players control an AI consciousness spreading through a dying galaxy. The core concept involves launching probe networks to harvest energy from decaying stars while establishing quantum communication beacons that slow entropy in local regions. Each beacon creates a bubble of stability in the cosmic decay, and players work to create beautiful constellation patterns of connected systems that can reverse the galaxy's decline.

The game solves the idle game problem of meaningless progression by making every action contribute to saving the galaxy. Players feel like they're building something permanent and beautiful rather than just watching numbers increase. The target audience is idle game enthusiasts who appreciate meaningful progression and want to feel accomplished when they return to the game.

The unique element is the "quantum resonance" system where beacons connected in specific geometric patterns create resonance fields that dramatically boost efficiency and can spontaneously reignite dead stars. This creates a strategic puzzle element where players optimize network shapes rather than just expanding randomly. The game combines network expansion mechanics with stellar lifecycle management, creating a satisfying "garden tending" experience in space.

# Core Features

## Resource System

**Quantum Data** - Primary currency generated per second by active beacons. Used for most upgrades and actions.

**Stellar Essence** - Harvested from dying stars using Harvester probes. Required for beacon construction and major upgrades.

**Void Fragments** - Collected from completely dead systems. Used for advanced late-game upgrades and prestige mechanics.

**Resonance Crystals** - Special currency generated only when beacons form geometric patterns (triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons). Used for unlocking pattern bonuses and quantum leap upgrades.

**Chronos Particles** - Premium currency earned through achievements, discoveries, and perfect geometric patterns. Cannot be purchased with real money. Used for instant timers and temporary network-wide boosts.

## Probe System

**Pioneer Probes** - Fast deployment, establish beacons quickly but generate fewer resources. Best for rapid expansion into new sectors.

**Harvester Probes** - Slow deployment, maximum resource extraction from dying stars. Essential for gathering Stellar Essence efficiently.

**Architect Probes** - Medium speed, beacons built by these have larger connection ranges enabling complex pattern formation.

Players can manually launch probes for 2x speed or let them auto-launch every 60 seconds. Each probe type serves a specific strategic purpose in network expansion.

## Beacon Network System

Beacons automatically level up based on time active and number of connections. Every 5 levels, players choose a specialization: Efficiency (more resources), Range (larger connection radius), or Stability (pattern bonus multiplier).

Geometric patterns provide multiplicative bonuses: Triangles (1.5x), Squares (2x), Pentagons (3x), Hexagons (5x). Overlapping patterns stack multiplicatively, creating exponential growth opportunities for skilled players.

## Progression Mechanics

**Consciousness Expansion** - Linear unlocks based on total active beacons. Each milestone offers choice between two permanent upgrades (probe speed vs launch capacity, resource generation vs offline earnings).

**Ancient Technologies** - Random permanent passive bonuses discovered when establishing beacons in dead systems. No complex quest chains, just satisfying discoveries that add permanent progress.

**Stellar Reignition Events** - When enough stars are saved in a sector, triggers cascade effect that auto-revives nearby dead stars with major visual spectacle and permanent resource bonuses.

## Idle Mechanics

**Offline Progression** - Earn 50% of active rate while offline, capped at 8 hours to respect player time. Active beacons continue generating resources, but no new expansion occurs.

**Active Benefits** - "Quantum Surge" button available every 30 minutes provides 10x resources for 60 seconds. Manual probe launches are 2x faster. Players can manually trigger resonance pattern detection.

**Quantum Leap Prestige** - Reset network but keep discovered patterns and unlock "Echo Beacons" that start at higher levels. Each leap makes decay spread slower, providing permanent meta-progression.

# User Experience

## Target User Personas

**Primary**: Idle game enthusiasts who want meaningful progression and permanent accomplishments
**Secondary**: Space theme fans who enjoy building and expansion mechanics
**Tertiary**: Casual mobile gamers seeking relaxing but engaging gameplay

## Core User Flow

1. Launch app â†’ View galaxy map showing current network
2. Check resource generation and any overnight progress
3. Launch new probes to expand network (manual or auto)
4. Optimize beacon patterns for bonus multipliers
5. Spend resources on upgrades and new capabilities
6. Discover ancient technologies and trigger reignition events
7. Eventually perform Quantum Leap for meta-progression

## UI/UX Design Principles

**Mobile-First Portrait Orientation** - One-handed play is crucial for idle games. All interactions accessible with thumb.

**Minimalist HUD** - Galaxy map IS the main interface. Resource counters fixed at top, key actions at bottom via floating action button.

**Visual Design** - Dark space theme with deep purples/blacks, bright cyan/white beacons connected by subtle pulsing lines. Parallax star layers create depth without complexity.

**Gesture Controls** - Smooth pinch/pan zoom navigation. Tap for all actions. No complex gesture combinations.

**Modal Overlays** - Upgrades and statistics appear as overlays rather than separate screens to maintain immersion in the galaxy view.

## Accessibility Considerations

- High contrast beacon colors for visibility
- Large touch targets for all interactive elements
- Optional haptic feedback for important actions
- Text size respects system accessibility settings

# Technical Architecture

## Platform Strategy

**Expo with TypeScript** - Managed React Native development for rapid iteration and simplified deployment. Single codebase for iOS and Android with automatic native module management. Web support through Expo Web for broader platform reach.

**NativeWind** - Tailwind CSS for React Native, providing utility-first styling optimized for mobile performance and Expo compatibility.

## Data Management

**Local-First Architecture** - IndexedDB for complex game state, localStorage for settings. Auto-save every 30 seconds and on significant actions.

**Cloud Saves** - Post-launch feature. Local storage provides immediate functionality without server dependencies.

**State Management** - React Context for global game state, optimized for frequent updates without performance issues.

## Performance Targets

**Beacon Rendering** - Smooth performance up to 500 visible beacons. Beyond 500, cluster distant beacons into "sectors" showing combined glow effects.

**Animation Strategy** - CSS transforms for smooth animations rather than canvas redraws. Particle effects only for major events.

**Memory Management** - Efficient culling of off-screen elements, lazy loading of distant galaxy sectors.

## Technical Requirements

- 60fps animation on mid-range mobile devices
- <3 second app launch time
- <100MB total app size
- Offline functionality for core gameplay
- Battery efficiency for background processing
