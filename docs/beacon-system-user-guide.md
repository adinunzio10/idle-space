## Connection System

Connections form automatically between beacons within range, creating the quantum communication network that generates resources.

### Connection Mechanics

**Automatic Formation**: Connections establish automatically when:
- Two beacons are within each other's range
- Both beacons have available connection slots
- Both beacons are active (not corrupted/inactive)

**Connection Strength** (1-5 scale):
- **Distance**: Closer beacons = stronger connections
- **Beacon Levels**: Higher level beacons = stronger connections  
- **Type Compatibility**: Certain type combinations get bonuses
- **Affects**: Visual thickness, data flow speed, pattern bonuses

### Connection Range Calculation
```
Effective Range = Base Range + (Level √ó 5) √ó Specialization Multiplier
```

**Examples**:
- Pioneer Level 10 with Signal Amplifier: 150 + (10√ó5) √ó 1.5 = **275 units**
- Harvester Level 5: 120 + (5√ó5) √ó 1.0 = **145 units**

### Connection Capacity
Beacons can only maintain a limited number of connections:
```
Max Connections = Base Max + (Level √∑ 10)
```

**Examples**:
- Pioneer Level 20: 3 + (20√∑10) = **5 connections**
- Architect Level 30: 6 + (30√∑10) = **9 connections**

### Visual Connection States

- **üü¢ Active (Green)**: Data flowing normally, contributing to patterns
- **üîµ Standard (Blue)**: Normal connection strength
- **üü° Weak (Yellow)**: Low strength due to distance/level difference
- **üî¥ Inactive (Red)**: Blocked by beacon status or technical issues
- **üü£ Pattern (Purple/Gold/Cyan)**: Part of a geometric pattern

## Beacon Placement

Strategic beacon placement is key to creating an efficient network:

### Placement Rules

- **Harvester**: Minimum 60 units from other beacons  
- **Architect**: Minimum 100 units from other beacons

#### Placement Cost
- **Pioneer**: 100 Quantum Data
- **Harvester**: 150 Quantum Data
- **Architect**: 200 Quantum Data

### Placement Strategy

#### Early Game (1-20 Beacons)
1. Place Pioneer beacons to establish basic network
2. Focus on creating simple triangle patterns
3. Maintain connection coverage across desired area

#### Mid Game (20-100 Beacons)
1. Add Harvester beacons in resource-dense areas
2. Start creating square patterns for better bonuses
3. Use first Architect beacons to connect distant clusters

#### Late Game (100+ Beacons)
1. Focus on complex pentagon and hexagon patterns
2. Use multiple Architect beacons for network coordination
3. Optimize for maximum pattern overlap and coverage

### Placement Validation

The game provides real-time feedback during placement:
- **‚úÖ Green Preview**: Valid placement location
- **‚ùå Red Preview**: Invalid placement with reason
- **üîó Connection Lines**: Shows potential connections
- **‚≠ï Territory Circle**: Shows beacon's effective range

Common validation failures:
- **Too Close**: Violates minimum distance requirement
- **Out of Bounds**: Beyond galaxy boundaries
- **Insufficient Resources**: Not enough Quantum Data
- **No Connections**: Would be isolated from network

## Upgrade System

Beacons grow stronger through leveling and specialization:

### Leveling Mechanics

#### Automatic Leveling
- Beacons level up automatically based on total resources generated
- **Formula**: Resources needed = 100 √ó 1.5^level
- **Benefits per level**:
  - +10% generation rate
  - +5 connection range
  - +1 connection slot every 10 levels

#### Level Milestones
- **Level 5, 10, 15, 20...**: Specialization choice available
- **Level 10, 20, 30...**: +1 connection slot
- **Level 50**: Maximum level (configurable)

### Specialization System

#### Timing
- First specialization available at Level 5
- New specialization choice every 5 levels
- Must choose specialization to continue leveling past milestone

#### Specialization Effects
- **Permanent**: Cannot be changed once selected
- **Immediate**: Bonuses apply instantly
- **Cumulative**: Each beacon can only have one specialization
- **Visual**: Changes beacon appearance and effects

### Upgrade Costs

#### Level Upgrade Costs
```
Cost = Base Cost √ó 1.5^(level-1)
```

**Base Costs**:
- Pioneer: 50 Quantum Data
- Harvester: 75 Quantum Data  
- Architect: 100 Quantum Data

#### Example Progression
Pioneer beacon upgrade costs:
- Level 1‚Üí2: 50 Quantum Data
- Level 2‚Üí3: 75 Quantum Data

## Pro Tips & Strategies

### Network Optimization
1. **Connection Efficiency**: Aim for 80-90% connection capacity usage
2. **Pattern Overlap**: Single beacons in multiple patterns are extremely valuable
3. **Type Distribution**: Balance all three beacon types (roughly 40% Pioneer, 35% Harvester, 25% Architect)

### Resource Management  
1. **Early Investment**: Prioritize beacon placement over individual upgrades early
2. **Specialization Planning**: Save resources for key specialization moments
3. **Pattern Focus**: Target one perfect pattern over multiple incomplete ones

### Visual Management
1. **Zoom Workflow**: Use high zoom for precision, low zoom for overview
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to spot potential patterns before placing beacons
3. **Connection Limits**: Monitor connection capacity before expanding

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Beacon Chains**: Create linear chains of beacons to extend network reach
2. **Hub Strategy**: Use high-level Architects as central hubs for multiple patterns
3. **Efficiency Clusters**: Group Harvester beacons with Efficiency specialization for maximum output
