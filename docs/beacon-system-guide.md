# Beacon System Guide - Understanding Your Galaxy

## What You're Seeing on the Galaxy Map

### Initial View Problem
When you first open the galaxy map, you see:
- **Background stars**: These are just visual decoration (small dots of different sizes)
- **Dark space background**: The galaxy map canvas
- **NO beacons visible initially**: You need to pan around to find them!

**The Issue**: The beacons are positioned at specific coordinates (100,100), (200,150), and (150,250), but the map doesn't automatically center on them. You need to drag/pan the map to find where they are located.

### Finding Your Beacons
1. **Pan around the map** by dragging your finger
2. Look for **3 distinct shapes** connected by **curved lines**:
   - A purple **diamond** (Pioneer beacon)
   - A green **circle** (Harvester beacon) 
   - A purple **hexagon/square** (Architect beacon)

## Beacon Types Explained

### 1. Pioneer Beacon (Purple Diamond ðŸ’Ž)
- **Shape**: Diamond/rhombus
- **Color**: Purple/Indigo (`#4F46E5`)
- **Purpose**: Fast expansion and exploration
- **Game Role**: Establishes new territories quickly
- **Visual**: Sharp diamond shape with purple glow

**Example**: beacon-1 at position (100,100), Level 1, connected to beacon-2

### 2. Harvester Beacon (Green Circle âš«)
- **Shape**: Circle
- **Color**: Green (`#10B981`) 
- **Purpose**: Resource extraction from dying stars
- **Game Role**: Generates Quantum Data and Stellar Essence
- **Visual**: Round circle with green glow

**Example**: beacon-2 at position (200,150), Level 1, connected to beacons 1 and 3

### 3. Architect Beacon (Purple Hexagon ðŸ”¶)
- **Shape**: Hexagon (or square when simplified)
- **Color**: Purple/Violet (`#7C3AED`)
- **Purpose**: Network building and pattern creation
- **Game Role**: Enables complex geometric patterns for bonuses
- **Visual**: Multi-sided polygon with violet glow

**Example**: beacon-3 at position (150,250), Level 2, connected to beacon-2

## Connection System (The Curved Lines)

### What the Curves Represent
- **Quantum communication links** between beacons
- **Resource flow pathways** for sharing energy and data
- **Pattern formation elements** for geometric bonuses
- **Network stability** - more connections = stronger network

### Connection Visual Features
- **Curved paths**: Not straight lines, but organic curves that look natural
- **Gradient colors**: Lines flow from one beacon's color toward another's
- **Strength indication**: Thicker/brighter lines = stronger connections
- **Pattern highlighting**: Special effects when forming geometric patterns

### Connection Strength Levels
1. **Basic connection** (thin line): Simple link between two beacons
2. **Strong connection** (thick line): High data flow, often in patterns
3. **Pattern connection** (glowing/pulsing): Part of a geometric pattern bonus
4. **Inactive connection** (dim line): Temporarily reduced activity

## Game Mechanics Behind What You See

### Beacon Levels
- **Level 1**: Basic functionality, small size
- **Level 2**: Enhanced capability, slightly larger with ring indicators
- **Higher levels**: More rings around the beacon, increased power

### Position Coordinates
- Your beacons are at galaxy coordinates: (100,100), (200,150), (150,250)
- These form a **triangle pattern** which should provide bonus multipliers
- Galaxy uses a coordinate system where each unit represents space distance

### Network Benefits
- **Triangle Pattern**: 1.5x resource bonus (your current setup!)
- **Connected network**: Resources flow between all beacons
- **Strategic placement**: Architect beacon can connect to distant locations

## Why the Initial Confusion?

### Navigation Issues
1. **No auto-centering**: Map doesn't automatically show your beacons
2. **Scale problems**: Default zoom might make beacons hard to spot
3. **Background clutter**: Stars can be mistaken for game elements

### Solutions
1. **Double-tap to zoom in** on areas to see details better
2. **Pan systematically** to explore the galaxy
3. **Look for the connected shapes** rather than individual dots
4. **Use the selection info** when you tap beacons to understand the system

## Sample Starting Network Explained

Your current 3-beacon setup represents:
- **beacon-1** (Pioneer): The initial exploration beacon
- **beacon-2** (Harvester): The main resource generator (connects to both others)
- **beacon-3** (Architect): Advanced network builder (higher level)

This forms a **starter triangle network** that should be generating resources and demonstrating the core game mechanics of expansion, harvesting, and network building.

## Next Steps for Understanding
1. **Find your beacons** by panning around the map
2. **Tap each beacon** to see their details and understand their roles
3. **Observe the connections** and how they link the network together
4. **Look for resource generation** happening through this network
5. **Experiment with placing new beacons** to expand the network
