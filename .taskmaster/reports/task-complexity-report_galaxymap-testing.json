			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Testing Infrastructure Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into: 1) Extend existing Jest utilities for spatial interface performance monitoring, 2) Create advanced gesture simulation with momentum and elastic behavior, 3) Enhance worklet isolation testing with memory leak detection, 4) Add specialized matchers for coordinate precision and viewport validation. Build incrementally on the existing 900+ line jest-setup.js and test-utils.ts foundation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to existing sophisticated infrastructure. The 900+ line jest-setup.js already provides advanced mocking. Need to enhance rather than rebuild. Worklet simulation is complex but patterns exist. Performance monitoring APIs need integration with existing React Native Performance mocks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Core Component Architecture Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Props validation suite with edge cases and malformed data, 2) ModuleManager integration testing with lifecycle verification, 3) React lifecycle testing during complex state transitions, 4) Error boundary and fallback mechanism testing, 5) Performance baseline establishment for component operations. Use existing ModuleStability test patterns as foundation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the intricate modular architecture. The GalaxyMapModular component has complex prop validation, module coordination, and React lifecycle management. Existing ModuleStability tests show this is non-trivial. Module system has event bus communication and adaptive behavior requiring thorough testing."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced Gesture System Testing Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Pan gesture testing with momentum and boundary constraints, 2) Pinch gesture with focal point accuracy and scale limits, 3) Tap gesture hit area and multi-tap validation, 4) Gesture composition and conflict resolution, 5) Performance monitoring during gesture interactions, 6) Accessibility gesture support testing. Enhance existing GestureTestUtils with realistic touch sequences.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to React Native Gesture Handler complexity and sophisticated existing gesture mocking. The jest-setup.js already has 100+ lines of gesture mocking, but realistic interaction sequences are complex. Worklet-based gesture handlers, momentum calculations, and simultaneous gesture handling add significant complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Spatial Mathematics Precision Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Coordinate transformation precision testing at extreme zoom levels, 2) Viewport bounds calculation accuracy across screen sizes, 3) Scale clamping and transition smoothness validation, 4) Elastic translation constraint testing, 5) Spatial indexing (rbush) performance benchmarking. Use property-based testing for mathematical invariants.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to floating-point precision requirements, extreme edge cases, and performance benchmarking needs. The spatial utility functions are already mocked but need comprehensive precision testing. Rbush spatial indexing is complex and requires performance validation with large datasets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Module System Integration Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: 1) Individual module testing (BeaconRendering, Connection, Environment, etc.), 2) ModuleManager lifecycle and registration testing, 3) Event bus communication and message validation, 4) Performance monitoring and adaptive behavior testing, 5) Resource management and cleanup verification. Build on existing MockModuleManager foundation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the modular architecture with 10+ module types, event bus communication, and adaptive performance systems. The ModuleManager.ts shows sophisticated lifecycle management, performance monitoring, and automatic module management. Integration testing across modules is inherently complex."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Benchmarking and Optimization Testing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) FPS monitoring during gesture interactions with large datasets, 2) Memory usage baselines and leak detection, 3) Performance optimization feature testing (LOD, culling), 4) Regression detection and baseline establishment, 5) Stress testing with extreme data scenarios, 6) Emergency mode activation and recovery testing. Integrate with existing Performance.test.tsx patterns.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to performance measurement requirements, React Native Performance API integration, and regression detection needs. Existing Performance.test.tsx shows this is complex. Need realistic data scenarios (100+ beacons), memory profiling, and automated regression detection in CI/CD."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "End-to-End User Workflow Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Complete user workflow simulation (pan→zoom→tap→select), 2) Multi-beacon interaction scenarios (50-500 beacons), 3) Cross-platform behavior consistency testing, 4) Long-running session and state persistence testing. Use existing React Native Testing Library patterns for workflow orchestration.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to workflow orchestration and cross-platform testing needs. The existing testing patterns can support this, but coordinating multiple gesture sequences and validating state persistence across long sessions requires careful test design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Memory Management and Resource Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: 1) Component lifecycle memory leak detection, 2) Gesture handler and worklet cleanup validation, 3) Long-running session simulation (30+ minutes), 4) Garbage collection effectiveness testing, 5) Memory pressure handling and cleanup verification. Extend existing MemoryLeak.test.tsx patterns.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to memory management in React Native + Reanimated environment. The existing MemoryLeak.test.tsx shows this is established but complex. Worklet memory management, shared value disposal, and long-running session testing require sophisticated memory monitoring."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Visual Regression and Rendering Testing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) SVG component tree validation and structure verification, 2) Rendering consistency across viewport states and zoom levels, 3) Screenshot comparison testing for critical UI states using Detox. Build on existing SVG mocking infrastructure.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to well-established SVG mocking in jest-setup.js and React Native Testing Library component tree validation. The existing mock infrastructure handles most complexity, making this more straightforward than other tasks."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Test Maintainability and CI/CD Integration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Documentation and best practices guide creation, 2) CI/CD optimization with parallel execution and smart test selection, 3) Automated quality monitoring with flaky test detection and coverage regression alerts. Focus on maintaining existing sophisticated patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Lower complexity due to mature existing infrastructure and established patterns. The comprehensive jest-setup.js and test-utils.ts provide solid foundation. Main work is documentation, CI/CD optimization, and quality monitoring rather than complex test implementation."
