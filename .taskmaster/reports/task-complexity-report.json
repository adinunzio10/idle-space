			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into: 1) Analyze all pending tasks to identify mixed frontend/backend work by examining implementation details and test strategies 2) Categorize each mixed task by separating frontend components (UI, UX, styling, client-side state) from backend components (API logic, database operations, business logic) 3) Create new frontend-focused tasks for UI components, user interactions, and visual design while updating original tasks to focus on backend implementation 4) Establish proper task dependencies and validate no functionality is lost between split tasks",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a project management and analysis task rather than heavy implementation work. The complexity is moderate because it requires: systematic analysis of existing tasks, understanding of frontend vs backend separation, task creation/modification through Task Master commands, and dependency management. However, it's not technically complex coding work - mainly organizational analysis and task manipulation using established Task Master workflows."
