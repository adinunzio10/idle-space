			"expansionPrompt": "Break down web gesture compatibility fixes into: 1) CSS touch-action implementation for preventing browser defaults, 2) React Native Gesture Handler web-specific configuration, 3) Event prevention and touch event handling, 4) WASM loading optimization and fallback implementation, 5) Metro bundler web optimization, 6) Cross-browser testing implementation, 7) Performance monitoring and debugging tools for web platform.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to platform-specific browser behavior differences. The codebase already has sophisticated gesture systems with worklets and state machines, but web compatibility requires extensive platform-specific handling. React Native Web has different touch event models than native platforms, requiring careful integration of CSS touch-action properties, event preventDefault patterns, and bundler optimizations. The 10 detailed requirements span multiple technical domains (CSS, JavaScript events, bundler configuration, WASM) making this complex to implement correctly across all browsers."
