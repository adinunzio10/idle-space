			"taskTitle": "Debug and Fix React Native Reanimated JSI Crashes in Galaxy Map",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into debugging phases: 1) JSI crash reproduction and analysis using React Native debugging tools, 2) Worklet context violation identification focusing on SharedValue serialization issues with Map/Set objects, 3) Gesture handler worklet boundary fixes with proper runOnJS() wrapping, 4) State machine integration debugging for react state access in worklets, 5) Memory leak prevention and comprehensive testing across iOS/Android with stress tests for rapid gesture combinations.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to advanced React Native Reanimated debugging, worklet boundary violations, and JSI crash investigation. The codebase shows sophisticated gesture handling with SharedValues and complex state machines. Task requires deep understanding of worklet execution contexts, memory management, and cross-platform debugging. The existing code has proper worklet patterns but needs debugging for JSI crashes, making this a challenging task requiring specialized React Native expertise."
