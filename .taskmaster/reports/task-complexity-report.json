			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the maximum update depth error fix into: 1) Audit and fix problematic useEffect hooks with circular dependencies (lines 97, 127, 157, 167, 338, 432), 2) Implement proper memoization for expensive computations (moduleContext, moduleElements), 3) Fix state update patterns that trigger re-renders in updatePerformanceMetrics and viewport updates, 4) Optimize gesture handler callbacks to prevent excessive re-renders during interactions, 5) Fix pendingViewportUpdate ref handling to prevent stale closure issues, 6) Refactor module system event handling to prevent cascading updates, 7) Add comprehensive error boundaries and performance monitoring",
			"reasoning": "After analyzing GalaxyMapModular.tsx, the component has high complexity due to: 6 useEffect hooks with complex dependencies (lines 97, 127, 157, 167, 338, 432), intricate module system architecture with event bus causing potential cascading updates, gesture handlers with runOnJS calls that could trigger render loops, performance monitoring that updates state during renders (updatePerformanceMetrics), viewport state updates that aren't properly throttled, and cached module render logic with circular dependency patterns. The error at line 65 suggests the component is re-rendering infinitely due to these interdependent state updates and effects."
