			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this ScrollView debugging task into specific diagnostic and implementation steps: 1) Investigate the current BaseOverlay implementation to identify why ScrollView content becomes invisible with contentContainerStyle, 2) Research React Native ScrollView best practices and common styling conflicts with NativeWind, 3) Implement the ScrollView fix with proper configuration and test across different content heights, 4) Create comprehensive testing scenarios for all overlay components using BaseOverlay to ensure the fix doesn't introduce regressions.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused debugging task for a specific React Native ScrollView issue. Based on the codebase analysis, the BaseOverlay component exists and is used by multiple overlay components, but the current implementation doesn't use ScrollView (lines 312-322 show a simple View wrapper). The task involves identifying the root cause of invisible content, implementing a proper ScrollView solution, and ensuring it works across all overlay components. The complexity is moderate because it's a well-defined UI issue with a known solution pattern, but requires thorough testing across multiple components."
