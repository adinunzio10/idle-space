			"taskTitle": "Fix React Native Reanimated Object Mutation Warnings in Beacon Rendering System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into systematic fixes for each problematic component and data flow pattern. Focus on: 1) Object cloning utilities creation, 2) BeaconRenderer component fixes (highest priority - 24 warnings), 3) BeaconRenderingModule fixes (complex module system), 4) VisualDecayEffects worklet isolation, 5) AccessibilityManager and AudioManager worklet data preparation, 6) Performance testing and validation of fixes.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex technical debt task affecting core rendering performance. Analysis shows 240 warnings across 10 object keys in 6 different components, with BeaconRenderer and BeaconRenderingModule being the most problematic. The codebase has sophisticated performance optimization systems (ObjectPool, spatial indexing) that must be preserved while fixing worklet mutation issues. The task requires deep understanding of React Native Reanimated worklet boundaries, object immutability patterns, and performance implications of object cloning strategies. The beacon rendering system is central to the game's visual performance, making this a high-stakes refactoring that could impact 60fps rendering targets."
