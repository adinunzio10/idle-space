			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this gesture system improvement task into specific subtasks focusing on: 1) Research phase analyzing current gesture implementation against industry standards and identifying specific improvement areas, 2) Gesture threshold and configuration optimization based on research findings, 3) Advanced gesture conflict resolution and state machine improvements, 4) Testing and validation suite implementation with performance monitoring and cross-platform verification.",
			"reasoning": "The project already has a sophisticated gesture system implemented with React Native Gesture Handler v2+ and proper worklet patterns. The GalaxyMapView component shows extensive gesture handling including pan, pinch, tap with proper conflict resolution, momentum physics, and velocity smoothing. The task is more about optimization and refinement rather than greenfield implementation, reducing complexity from what would be 8-9 for a new system to 6. The existing patterns show good understanding of gesture hierarchies and performance optimization."
