			"expansionPrompt": "Break down pattern suggestion performance optimization into specific implementation subtasks: 1) R-tree spatial indexing implementation to replace existing spatial grid, 2) Debounced pattern calculation with configurable thresholds, 3) Incremental pattern validation for viewport-only updates, 4) LRU pattern suggestion caching enhancement, 5) React.memo and useMemo optimization for PatternSuggestion components, 6) Viewport culling with buffer zone implementation, 7) WebWorker integration for complex pattern calculations, 8) SVG rendering optimization with shouldComponentUpdate, 9) Progressive pattern complexity with staged rendering, 10) Performance monitoring integration with expo-perf-monitor and frame rate tracking.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity (6/10) due to: **Existing Infrastructure Advantage**: PatternSuggestionEngine, SpatialPatternCache, PerformanceMonitor, and spatial indexing already implemented, reducing implementation effort by ~60%. **Optimization vs Greenfield**: Task involves enhancing existing systems rather than building from scratch - most algorithms, data structures, and performance monitoring already exist. **Technical Depth Required**: R-tree implementation, WebWorker integration, and React performance optimizations require solid understanding of algorithms and React Native internals. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Optimizations must work on iOS, Android, and web with different performance characteristics. **Performance Testing Complexity**: Requires sophisticated benchmarking with 500+ beacons and frame rate monitoring. Complexity reduced from 8+ to 6 because core pattern detection, caching systems, performance monitoring, and spatial data structures are already implemented and just need enhancement rather than creation."
