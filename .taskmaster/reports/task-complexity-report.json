      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down project initialization into configuration phases: 1) Initial Expo project creation with TypeScript template, 2) Development tooling setup (ESLint, Prettier, scripts), 3) Essential dependencies installation (NativeWind, gesture handlers), 4) Platform configuration and build verification. Each subtask should include validation steps and error handling for common setup issues.",
      "reasoning": "This is a standard project setup task with well-established patterns. The complexity is moderate due to the specific version requirements and multiple configuration steps, but follows documented Expo workflows. Since the project directory is currently empty, this is a greenfield setup."
