			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the React Native testing infrastructure improvements into specific technical implementation subtasks: 1) Jest configuration updates for ES module handling (expo-battery, rbush transformIgnorePatterns), 2) Native module mock implementations for AsyncStorage, expo-battery, gesture-handler, reanimated, SVG, and rbush, 3) Worklet execution context simulator development with runOnJS() and SharedValue support, 4) Test utility library creation building on existing ModuleStability.simple.test.tsx pattern, 5) Integration test framework for gesture interactions, 6) Performance and stability test suite, 7) Mock gesture recognizer system, and 8) Component rendering test infrastructure with proper context providers.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to React Native testing challenges including: 1) Multiple cascade dependencies requiring sophisticated mocking (6+ native modules), 2) Worklet context simulation requiring deep understanding of Reanimated architecture, 3) Existing Jest configuration needs significant updates for ES modules, 4) Testing infrastructure must handle both logic-only and full integration scenarios, 5) Current codebase shows successful simple testing approach that needs expansion, 6) Gesture simulation requires complex state management and event sequencing. Based on analysis: Jest config exists but needs transformIgnorePatterns updates, comprehensive mock infrastructure already partially implemented in jest-setup.js, successful simple tests indicate good foundation, but full React Native component testing with gestures and worklets requires substantial additional infrastructure."
