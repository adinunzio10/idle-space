			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks focusing on: 1) Comprehensive audit of all Reanimated usage patterns, 2) Fix gesture handler worklet violations, 3) Fix animation callback worklet violations, 4) Documentation and testing of worklet patterns. Each subtask should address specific files and worklet boundary issues found in the codebase.",
			"reasoning": "Based on codebase analysis, I found React Native Reanimated 3.17.4 is properly integrated with existing worklet usage in GalaxyMapView.tsx and viewport.ts utilities. The code already demonstrates good worklet practices with proper runOnJS() wrapping and 'worklet' directives. However, there are potential issues in ConnectionRenderer.tsx which uses Reanimated components but may need worklet compliance for animations. The complexity is moderate (6/10) because the foundation is solid but requires systematic review of all animation code paths, especially the FlowEffect component which mentions future Reanimated integration. The task involves technical debugging of UI/JS thread boundaries and performance-critical code paths."
