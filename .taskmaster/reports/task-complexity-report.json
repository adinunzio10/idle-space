			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Basic Upgrade and Progression System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a comprehensive upgrade system with milestone-based progression. Build UpgradeManager with exponential cost scaling and validation. Implement Consciousness Expansion milestones (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 beacons) with choice-based upgrades. Add upgrade preview calculations and unlock conditions for advanced upgrades. Include persistent upgrade data management and UI integration for seamless user experience.",
			"reasoning": "Complex system requiring new UpgradeManager class, milestone detection logic, choice-based progression mechanics, and UI integration. Existing BeaconUpgradeManager suggests some upgrade infrastructure exists but scope requires significant new development for milestone system and choice mechanics. Moderate complexity due to business logic complexity but builds on existing beacon/resource systems."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimization and Polish",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Enhance existing performance monitoring system with LOD improvements, visual polish, and battery optimization. Extend current PerformanceMonitor class with FPS tracking and expo-gl-cpp integration. Implement React.memo and useMemo optimizations for expensive pattern calculations. Add object pooling for animations and particle effects. Create visual effects (glows, pulsing, particles) while maintaining performance targets. Integrate expo-battery for adaptive performance based on device state.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as existing PerformanceMonitor infrastructure provides solid foundation. Task involves extending current system rather than building from scratch. Visual polish adds complexity but performance monitoring framework already handles quality adjustment. Requires React optimization patterns and new visual effects implementation. Battery optimization requires new expo-battery integration."

		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Web Gesture Handling and React Native Web Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Resolve complex web platform compatibility issues with gesture handling and React Native Web. Implement CSS touch-action properties to prevent browser conflicts. Configure React Native Gesture Handler for web-specific behavior with simultaneous recognizers and touch sensitivity adjustments. Add proper event prevention and WASM optimization for worklets. Configure Metro bundler for optimized web builds with code splitting. Implement cross-browser testing framework and web-specific debugging tools.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to cross-platform compatibility challenges and web-specific optimization requirements. No existing web gesture handling infrastructure found in codebase. Task requires deep understanding of React Native Web limitations, browser event handling differences, and WASM optimization. Metro configuration and cross-browser testing add significant complexity. Multiple integration points with existing gesture systems need careful coordination."

		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Redesign Resource Cost Model for Probe and Beacon Economics",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Refactor existing ProbeManager and BeaconManager economic model by removing resource costs from probe launches and implementing escalating beacon placement costs. Modify ProbeManager to eliminate resource validation for launches while maintaining time-based delays. Update BeaconPlacementValidator and ResourceManager for new exponential beacon cost formula (50 QD * 1.5^beacon_count). Add cost preview UI and rebalance resource generation rates. Update tutorial system to reflect new economic model.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it requires modifying existing well-established systems (ProbeManager already implemented with resource costs). Core business logic changes across multiple managers but builds on existing infrastructure. Cost calculation and UI preview are straightforward. Main complexity lies in coordinating changes across ProbeManager, BeaconManager, ResourceManager, and UI components while maintaining game balance."

		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Populate Settings Screen with Configuration Options and Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive settings system on existing SettingsModal foundation. Create SettingsContext with React Context and AsyncStorage persistence for all configuration categories (game, display, accessibility, audio, data management). Implement form controls for auto-save intervals, performance toggles, accessibility features, and data import/export. Integrate with existing SaveManager and performance monitoring systems. Add input validation, error handling, and immediate setting application without app restart.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as basic SettingsModal exists but requires significant expansion. Context system and AsyncStorage integration are straightforward React Native patterns. Integration with existing SaveManager and performance systems requires coordination but interfaces already exist. Data management features (import/export/reset) add complexity. Form validation and immediate setting application require careful state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Pattern Toggle Button and Overlay Functionality Issues",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Debug and resolve critical pattern system regressions from Task 18 state management refactor. Fix PatternToggleButton count display and gesture handling issues. Debug pentagon detection inconsistencies in PatternDetector geometric validation. Resolve race conditions in PatternSuggestionContext pattern count calculations with debouncing. Rebuild PatternSuggestionOverlay SVG integration with new context system. Conduct comprehensive state management audit with React DevTools profiling to identify root causes.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to debugging nature and multiple interconnected system failures. Existing PatternSuggestionContext and complex pattern detection system (PatternDetector class exists) suggest sophisticated infrastructure but with post-refactor regressions. Race conditions and SVG overlay issues require deep debugging skills. Pentagon detection geometry problems involve complex mathematical validation. State management audit across multiple React components requires systematic debugging approach."
