# Task ID: 37
# Title: Create Probe Targeting and Direction Control UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a user interface that allows players to influence probe expansion direction with targeting modes for dying star systems, pattern completion, and empty sector exploration, including visual indicators for probable probe placement zones.
# Details:
Create ProbeTargetingManager class with three targeting modes: 1) **Dying Star Priority**: Automatically target sectors containing dying star systems for Stellar Essence harvesting, using galaxy sector data to identify optimal expansion paths. 2) **Pattern Completion**: Analyze existing beacon network to identify incomplete geometric patterns and direct probes toward positions that would complete triangles, squares, pentagons, or hexagons. 3) **Empty Sector Exploration**: Target unexplored sectors for balanced expansion, avoiding areas with existing beacon coverage. Implement TargetingUI component with toggle buttons for each mode, positioned in the probe launch interface. Create ProbePlacementPredictor that calculates and displays visual probability zones using heat map overlays on the galaxy map - red zones for dying star targets, blue zones for pattern completion, green zones for exploration. Use react-native-svg to render semi-transparent colored regions showing likely probe deployment areas based on current targeting algorithm. Add ProbePathCalculator that considers targeting mode, existing beacon positions, probe type capabilities, and resource availability to determine optimal expansion vectors. Implement visual feedback system showing targeting mode status in HUD and probe queue interface. Store targeting preferences in save system to persist player choices across sessions.

# Test Strategy:
Test each targeting mode independently by placing probes and verifying they follow expected expansion patterns toward dying stars, pattern completion spots, or empty sectors. Validate visual probability zones update correctly when switching between targeting modes and accurately represent calculated probe placement likelihood. Test targeting mode persistence across app restarts and save/load cycles. Verify pattern completion targeting correctly identifies incomplete geometric formations and suggests optimal probe positions. Test performance with multiple targeting calculations running simultaneously during automated probe launches. Validate heat map overlay rendering performance with complex beacon networks and verify visual indicators don't interfere with galaxy map navigation.
