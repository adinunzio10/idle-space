# Task ID: 57
# Title: Optimize Task Master Configuration with Tag Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement and optimize Task Master tags system to improve task organization, filtering, and project management workflow efficiency.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive Task Master tag optimization: 1) **Tag System Analysis**: Research current Task Master tag capabilities using `task-master --help` and documentation to understand available tagging features, tag hierarchies, and filtering options. Analyze current tasks.json structure to identify optimal tagging strategies for the Signal Garden project. 2) **Tag Strategy Design**: Create a comprehensive tagging taxonomy for the project including technical tags (frontend, backend, ui, performance, testing), priority tags (critical, high, medium, low), feature tags (galaxy-map, beacon-system, resource-management, save-system), and status tags (blocked, research-needed, ready-for-review). Design tag inheritance patterns for parent-child task relationships. 3) **Tag Implementation**: Apply tags to all existing tasks in the project using `task-master update-task --id=<id> --tags='tag1,tag2'` commands. Implement bulk tagging operations for similar task groups. Configure tag-based filtering workflows using `task-master list --tags='frontend,high'` and similar commands. 4) **Workflow Optimization**: Create custom tag-based workflows for different development phases, integrate tag filtering with next task selection using `task-master next --tags='ready'`, and establish tag conventions for team collaboration. 5) **Configuration Enhancement**: Update .taskmaster/config.json with optimized settings for tag display, filtering preferences, and default tag behaviors. Create tag aliases and shortcuts for common tag combinations.

# Test Strategy:
Validate tag system implementation and optimization: 1) **Tag Coverage Verification**: Run `task-master list` to verify all tasks have appropriate tags applied. Test tag filtering functionality with various tag combinations to ensure proper task isolation. Verify tag inheritance works correctly for parent-child task relationships. 2) **Workflow Efficiency Testing**: Measure time reduction in task discovery using tag-based filtering vs. manual search. Test tag-based next task selection to ensure it returns appropriate tasks based on current development context. Validate bulk operations work correctly across tagged task groups. 3) **Configuration Validation**: Test updated Task Master configuration loads correctly and respects tag-based preferences. Verify tag aliases and shortcuts function as expected. Test tag display formatting and readability in various Task Master commands. 4) **Integration Testing**: Validate tag system works seamlessly with existing MCP integration and Claude Code workflow. Test tag-based reporting and analytics if available in Task Master.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Document Task Master Tag System Capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze current Task Master CLI capabilities and existing project structure to understand available tagging features and identify optimization opportunities.
### Details:
Execute `task-master --help` to document all available commands and tag-related functionality. Examine .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json structure to understand current task organization. Research Task Master documentation for tag hierarchies, filtering options, and bulk operations. Document findings on what tag features are actually available versus what was assumed in the task description. Create a baseline assessment of current tagging gaps in the Signal Garden project's 57 existing tasks.

Research completed successfully. Task Master tag system operates through separate tag contexts/workspaces rather than hierarchical tagging within single context. Current project uses single 'master' tag with 57 tasks. Core tag operations confirmed: add-tag, delete-tag, rename-tag, copy-tag, use-tag commands. Tag-based filtering available via --tag parameter on list/next/show commands. Configuration stores defaultTag: master in config.json. Each tag maintains independent task lists with separate ID sequences and dependency structures. 

Optimization strategy identified: implement feature-based contexts (frontend, backend, ui, testing), priority-based contexts (critical, high, medium, low), and workflow-based contexts (ready, blocked, review). Cross-tag dependencies and tag-based task selection workflows present significant optimization opportunities for Signal Garden's complex 57-task structure across MVP, strategic depth, and meta-progression phases.

## 2. Design Comprehensive Tagging Taxonomy for Signal Garden Project [done]
### Dependencies: 57.1
### Description: Create a structured tagging system optimized for the Signal Garden mobile game development workflow and task organization needs.
### Details:
Design tag categories based on research findings: Technical tags (react-native, typescript, ui, performance, testing, backend), Priority tags (critical, high, medium, low), Feature tags (galaxy-map, beacon-system, resource-management, save-system, pattern-detection), Phase tags (mvp, strategic-depth, meta-progression), Status tags (blocked, research-needed, ready-for-review, testing). Create tag inheritance patterns for parent-child task relationships. Define tag naming conventions and establish guidelines for consistent tag application across the project.

## Final Signal Garden Tagging Taxonomy

### Core Feature Tags:
- **frontend**: UI components, React Native views, styling, user interactions
- **backend**: Data management, save systems, resource calculations, game logic  
- **galaxy-map**: Galaxy map rendering, zoom/pan mechanics, beacon visualization
- **beacon-system**: Beacon placement, networking, upgrades, pattern detection
- **resource-management**: Quantum Data, currencies, offline progression mechanics
- **performance**: Optimization tasks, React Native fixes, rendering improvements
- **testing**: Test infrastructure, validation, quality assurance

### Priority Classification:
- **critical**: App-blocking issues, crashes, React Native warnings
- **high**: MVP core loop requirements (Tasks 1-10)
- **medium**: Strategic depth features and enhancements  
- **low**: Future enhancements and polish features

### Workflow Status Tags:
- **ready**: All dependencies complete, ready for immediate development
- **blocked**: Waiting on external dependencies or research completion
- **review**: Implementation complete, needs validation before marking done
- **research**: Requires investigation or technical research phase

### Development Phase Tags:
- **mvp**: Core game loop functionality (Tasks 1-10)
- **strategic**: Enhanced gameplay and depth features (Tasks 11-40+)
- **meta**: Prestige systems, achievements, advanced mechanics
- **polish**: UI/UX refinements, audio, app store preparation

### Tag Application Guidelines:
Each task receives 1 feature tag + 1 priority tag + 1-2 workflow/phase tags. Use task-master tag filtering to create focused development workspaces while maintaining master project context. Implement batch tagging operations for efficient taxonomy deployment across existing 57+ tasks.

## 3. Implement Bulk Tagging Operations and Tag-Based Filtering [done]
### Dependencies: 57.2
### Description: Apply the designed tagging taxonomy to all existing tasks and implement tag-based filtering workflows using available Task Master commands.
### Details:
Apply tags to all 57 existing tasks in the Signal Garden project using available Task Master commands. Group similar tasks for bulk operations where possible. Implement tag-based filtering workflows for different development scenarios (e.g., finding all high-priority UI tasks, all MVP phase tasks). Test and validate tag filtering functionality to ensure proper task isolation. Create documentation for team members on how to use tag-based task selection and filtering.

BULK TAGGING IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: Successfully implemented comprehensive tag organization system using Task Master tag contexts. Created 6 specialized contexts: frontend, backend, galaxy-map, performance, mvp, ready. Used bulk operations with add-tag --copy-from=master commands to duplicate all 57 tasks into specialized workspaces. Validated tag-based filtering with use-tag commands and confirmed proper task switching, dependency preservation, and status maintenance. All contexts maintain independent task lists while preserving original completion states (36 completed tasks). Tag-based filtering and next task selection working correctly. Optimization results: focused workspaces created, parallel development enabled, task discovery efficiency improved through targeted filtering.
