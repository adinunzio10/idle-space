# Task ID: 58
# Title: Review and Split Mixed Frontend/Backend Tasks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze all pending tasks to identify those containing both frontend and backend components, then extract frontend work into separate dedicated tasks while updating original tasks to focus solely on backend implementation.
# Details:
1. **Task Analysis Phase**: Execute `task-master list --status=pending` to retrieve all pending tasks. Review each task's implementation details and test strategy to identify mixed frontend/backend work patterns such as: API endpoint creation with UI components, database operations with user interface, backend services with corresponding frontend integrations, full-stack feature implementations. 2. **Task Categorization**: Create systematic analysis of each mixed task to determine: which components are purely backend (API logic, database operations, service layer, authentication), which components are purely frontend (UI components, user interactions, styling, client-side state management), natural separation points for splitting functionality. 3. **Task Splitting Strategy**: For each identified mixed task, create new frontend-focused tasks that include: UI component development, user experience implementation, client-side state management, visual design and styling. Update original tasks to focus exclusively on: backend API development, database operations, business logic implementation, server-side processing. 4. **Dependency Management**: Establish proper dependencies where frontend tasks depend on corresponding backend tasks to ensure logical implementation order. Use `task-master add-task` for new frontend tasks and `task-master update-task` for backend task modifications. 5. **Documentation**: Ensure clear separation of concerns in task descriptions, avoiding overlap while maintaining comprehensive coverage of original requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify task splitting accuracy by reviewing each modified task to ensure no functionality is lost or duplicated between frontend and backend versions. Confirm all new frontend tasks have appropriate dependencies on their backend counterparts. Test task workflow by running `task-master next` to ensure logical task ordering is maintained. Validate that implementation details in split tasks are specific to their respective domains (frontend tasks should not reference database operations, backend tasks should not reference UI components). Review test strategies in split tasks to ensure they test appropriate layers (frontend tests focus on UI behavior, backend tests focus on business logic and data operations).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze All Pending Tasks for Frontend/Backend Separation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Execute task-master list --status=pending and systematically review each task to identify mixed frontend/backend components by examining implementation details and test strategies.
### Details:
Use task-master list command to retrieve all pending tasks. Create analysis document identifying tasks with mixed concerns such as API endpoints with UI components, database operations with user interfaces, and full-stack feature implementations. Categorize findings into clear frontend vs backend components.

## 2. Create New Frontend-Focused Tasks [done]
### Dependencies: 58.1
### Description: Extract frontend components from mixed tasks and create dedicated frontend tasks using task-master add-task for UI components, user interactions, styling, and client-side state management.
### Details:
For each identified mixed task, create new frontend tasks covering UI component development, user experience implementation, visual design, and client-side state management. Use task-master add-task with appropriate descriptions and implementation details focused solely on frontend concerns.

## 3. Update Original Tasks to Backend-Only Focus [done]
### Dependencies: 58.1
### Description: Modify existing mixed tasks using task-master update-task to remove frontend components and focus exclusively on backend implementation including API logic, database operations, and business logic.
### Details:
Update each identified mixed task to focus solely on backend concerns: API development, database operations, business logic implementation, and server-side processing. Remove all frontend-related implementation details and test strategies while ensuring comprehensive backend coverage.

## 4. Establish Task Dependencies and Validate Coverage [done]
### Dependencies: 58.2, 58.3
### Description: Create proper dependencies between new frontend tasks and their corresponding backend tasks using task-master add-dependency, then validate that no functionality is lost in the splitting process.
### Details:
Use task-master add-dependency to establish logical implementation order where frontend tasks depend on their backend counterparts. Review all split tasks to ensure complete coverage of original requirements without overlap or missing functionality. Test workflow with task-master next to verify proper task sequencing.
