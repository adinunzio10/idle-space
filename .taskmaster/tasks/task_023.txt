# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Living Galactic Environment with Dynamic Star Systems
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform the galaxy map from empty space with beacons to a rich galactic environment featuring background star systems in three states (healthy, dying, dead), visible sector boundaries, entropy decay effects, and interactive overlays for resource harvesting.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive galactic environment system building on the existing galaxy map infrastructure: 1) **Star System Generation**: Implement procedural star system placement using Poisson disk sampling for natural distribution. Create StarSystem component with three states: healthy (dim white, #E5E7EB), dying (orange/red gradient #F59E0B to #EF4444, harvestable for Stellar Essence), and dead (dark gray #374151, source of Void Fragments). Use react-native-svg for scalable star rendering with animated pulsing for dying stars. 2) **Sector System Implementation**: Create SectorManager to divide galaxy into logical regions using Voronoi diagrams or hexagonal grid system. Implement SectorBoundary component with subtle line rendering (#6B7280, 0.3 opacity) that become visible at zoom levels >0.3x. Add entropy level visualization per sector using background color tinting from blue (low entropy) to red (high entropy). 3) **Entropy Decay System**: Implement EntropySpreadManager using cellular automata principles where entropy spreads from high-entropy sectors to adjacent low-entropy sectors over time. Create visual decay effects using particle systems or animated gradients showing entropy creeping between sector boundaries. Add time-based decay simulation that affects star system states over gameplay sessions. 4) **Interactive Overlays**: Create HarvestOverlay component that highlights harvestable resources when players zoom beyond 0.5x. Implement ResourceIndicator showing dying stars with Stellar Essence amounts and dead systems with Void Fragment potential. Add touch/tap interactions for resource collection with visual feedback and state updates. 5) **Performance Optimization**: Implement level-of-detail rendering where star systems render as points at low zoom, detailed sprites at medium zoom, and full animated components at high zoom. Use spatial indexing (R-tree) for efficient sector and star system culling. Implement virtualization for off-screen star systems to maintain 60fps with thousands of systems. 6) **Integration with Existing Systems**: Extend GalaxyMapView to include StarSystemRenderer and SectorRenderer as background layers beneath existing beacon rendering. Update GameController to manage star system states and entropy progression. Integrate resource collection with existing Stellar Essence and Void Fragments systems from the resource management.

# Test Strategy:
Verify star systems render correctly in all three states with appropriate visual styling and animations. Test sector boundary visibility at different zoom levels without interfering with beacon rendering. Validate entropy spread simulation progresses naturally over time affecting adjacent sectors. Test resource overlay highlighting works accurately for dying and dead star systems. Verify touch interactions for resource collection update game state correctly. Performance test with 1000+ star systems maintaining 60fps across zoom levels. Test level-of-detail system transitions smoothly between rendering modes. Validate procedural generation creates consistent, natural-looking galactic distribution. Test memory usage remains stable during extended gameplay with entropy simulation running.
