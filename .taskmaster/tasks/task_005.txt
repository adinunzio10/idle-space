# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Beacon Placement and Management System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement manual beacon placement mechanics with automatic leveling, specialization choices, and connection range visualization.
# Details:
Create Beacon class with properties: position, level, connections[], specialization, generationRate. Implement placement validation preventing overlaps using spatial grid. Add BeaconUpgradeManager for automatic leveling every 5 levels with specialization choices: Efficiency (+25% resources), Range (+50% connection radius), Stability (+100% pattern bonus multiplier). Use Voronoi diagrams for connection range visualization. Implement connection detection using distance-based algorithm with configurable range per beacon type. Add visual feedback for valid placement zones and connection previews.

# Test Strategy:
Test beacon placement validation edge cases. Verify automatic leveling triggers and specialization UI. Test connection detection accuracy with various beacon configurations. Performance testing with rapid beacon placement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Beacon Entity Class with Core Properties [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the Beacon class with essential properties including position, level, connections array, specialization type, and generation rate with proper TypeScript interfaces.
### Details:
Define Beacon interface with properties: id, position (x, y coordinates), level (number), connections (array of beacon IDs), specialization (enum: none, efficiency, range, stability), generationRate (number), and createdAt timestamp. Implement BeaconFactory for creating new beacon instances with default values. Add validation methods for beacon state consistency.

## 2. Implement Spatial Grid Placement Validation System [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create collision detection system using spatial grid to prevent beacon overlaps and validate placement positions with configurable minimum distances.
### Details:
Implement SpatialGrid class with grid-based partitioning for efficient collision detection. Create PlacementValidator with methods: isValidPosition(), checkOverlaps(), and getMinimumDistance(). Add configurable beacon spacing rules and boundary validation. Optimize for O(1) average case collision detection using spatial hashing.

## 3. Build Automatic Leveling and Specialization System [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop BeaconUpgradeManager for automatic leveling every 5 levels with specialization choices and progression tracking.
### Details:
Create BeaconUpgradeManager class with automatic leveling triggers based on resource generation milestones. Implement specialization system with three types: Efficiency (+25% resources), Range (+50% connection radius), Stability (+100% pattern bonus). Add SpecializationUI modal for player choice during upgrades. Track upgrade history and progression statistics.

## 4. Implement Connection Detection and Range Algorithms [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Create distance-based connection detection system with configurable range calculations per beacon specialization type.
### Details:
Implement ConnectionManager with distance-based algorithm for detecting beacon connections within range. Create configurable range calculations: base range 100 units, Range specialization +50%, level-based scaling. Add connection strength calculation based on distance and beacon levels. Optimize connection detection using spatial indexing for performance with many beacons.

## 5. Create Visual Feedback System with Voronoi Diagrams [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.4
### Description: Implement Voronoi diagram visualization for connection ranges and visual feedback for valid placement zones with real-time preview updates.
### Details:
Integrate Voronoi diagram library for connection range visualization. Create PlacementPreview component showing valid zones in green, invalid in red. Implement real-time connection preview lines during beacon placement. Add visual indicators for beacon specializations and upgrade availability. Use react-native-svg for efficient rendering of complex geometric shapes.
