# Task ID: 39
# Title: Create Pattern Discovery Gallery UI with Visual Collection Display
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a comprehensive pattern gallery screen that displays all discovered geometric patterns with visual representations, rarity indicators, discovery timestamps, bonus multipliers, and completion tracking accessible from the main HUD.
# Details:
Implement PatternGalleryScreen component with comprehensive pattern collection visualization: 1) **Gallery Grid Layout**: Create scrollable grid using FlatList displaying pattern cards with visual SVG representations of each discovered geometric formation (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon). Each card shows the actual beacon configuration that was discovered. 2) **Pattern Metadata Display**: Show discovery timestamp, current bonus multiplier value (1.5x for triangles through 5x for hexagons), rarity classification based on formation complexity and discovery frequency. Include completion percentage tracking how many unique variations of each pattern type have been found. 3) **Visual Pattern Rendering**: Use react-native-svg to render miniature versions of each pattern configuration, showing beacon positions and connecting lines in the same visual style as the galaxy map overlays. 4) **Rarity System Integration**: Implement rarity classification (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary) based on pattern complexity, overlapping formations, and discovery frequency. Highlight rare formations with special border effects and animations. 5) **HUD Integration**: Add 'Patterns' button to main screen floating action button array that opens the gallery screen with slide-up animation. Include pattern count badge showing total discovered patterns. 6) **Data Management**: Extend PatternDetector to persist pattern discoveries with timestamps and metadata in save system. Create PatternCollection class managing discovered patterns, rarity calculations, and completion tracking across game sessions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify pattern gallery displays all discovered patterns from PatternDetector system with accurate visual representations matching actual beacon configurations. Test rarity indicators correctly classify patterns based on complexity and discovery frequency. Validate discovery timestamps persist across app sessions and display in readable format. Test completion percentage calculations accurately reflect pattern discovery progress. Verify gallery access button integrates smoothly with main HUD without interfering with existing floating UI elements. Test scroll performance with large numbers of discovered patterns maintaining 60fps.
