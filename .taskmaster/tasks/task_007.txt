# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Computational Geometry Foundation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create core geometric calculation utilities for angle and distance measurements between beacon positions
### Details:
Build GeometryUtils class with methods for calculating angles between three points, distances between beacons, and determining if points form valid geometric shapes. Implement vector mathematics for 2D coordinates including dot products, cross products, and normalization. Add utility functions for determining interior angles of polygons and checking point-in-polygon algorithms.

## 2. Develop Shape Detection Algorithms [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement detection algorithms for triangle, square, pentagon, and hexagon formations with their respective multipliers
### Details:
Create ShapeDetector class with methods for detecting each geometric shape: detectTriangle() (1.5x bonus), detectSquare() (2x bonus), detectPentagon() (3x bonus), detectHexagon() (5x bonus). Use angle tolerance checking and side length validation to identify valid formations. Implement robust pattern matching that handles slightly imperfect beacon placements while maintaining geometric integrity.

## 3. Implement Delaunay Triangulation System [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Build efficient geometric analysis using Delaunay triangulation for optimal pattern detection performance
### Details:
Integrate Delaunay triangulation library or implement custom algorithm for beacon coordinate analysis. Create TriangulationEngine that preprocesses beacon positions into triangulated mesh for efficient neighbor finding. Use triangulation to quickly identify potential pattern candidates and reduce computational complexity from O(nÂ³) to O(n log n) for pattern detection.

## 4. Create Pattern Bonus Calculator [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop multiplicative stacking system for overlapping patterns with accurate bonus calculations
### Details:
Build PatternBonusCalculator class that handles multiplicative stacking when patterns overlap or share beacons. Implement logic to detect overlapping formations and apply cumulative multipliers correctly. Create bonus validation system that prevents double-counting shared vertices while ensuring maximum bonus potential is achieved for complex arrangements.

## 5. Build Visual Pattern Highlighting System [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create react-native-svg overlay system for highlighting detected patterns with visual feedback
### Details:
Implement PatternRenderer component using react-native-svg to draw colored overlays on detected geometric patterns. Create distinct visual styles for each pattern type with appropriate colors and line weights. Add smooth animations for pattern appearance/disappearance and highlight effects when patterns contribute bonuses. Ensure overlays scale properly with zoom levels and don't interfere with beacon interaction.

## 6. Implement Spatial Hashing Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Add spatial hashing system for O(1) pattern lookup performance and pattern suggestion UI
### Details:
Create SpatialHashMap class that divides the galaxy into grid cells for efficient beacon neighbor queries. Implement hash-based lookup system that enables O(1) average-case performance for pattern detection. Add PatternSuggestionEngine that analyzes current beacon placement and suggests optimal positions for completing patterns. Include UI components for displaying placement hints and potential bonus calculations.
