# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Polish
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add performance monitoring, level-of-detail systems, and visual polish to ensure smooth 60fps gameplay on target devices.
# Details:
Implement LOD system: full beacon rendering <100 beacons, simplified icons 100-500, cluster rendering >500. Add FPS monitoring using expo-gl-cpp for performance tracking. Optimize React Native renders using React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations. Implement object pooling for probe animations and particle effects. Add performance budgets: <100ms for user interactions, <16ms for animation frames. Use react-native-flipper for development profiling. Add visual polish: glow effects for beacons, pulsing connections, smooth probe travel animations. Implement battery optimization using expo-battery for background processing limits.

# Test Strategy:
Performance profiling on mid-range devices (iPhone SE, Android mid-tier). Frame rate monitoring during intensive scenarios. Memory usage testing with maximum beacon counts. Battery drain testing during extended gameplay sessions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Level-of-Detail (LOD) System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create adaptive rendering system that switches between full beacon rendering (<100 beacons), simplified icons (100-500), and cluster rendering (>500) based on beacon count.
### Details:
Implement beacon count detection and automatic switching between rendering modes. Create simplified icon versions of beacons. Develop cluster rendering algorithm for high beacon counts. Add smooth transitions between LOD levels to prevent visual jarring.

Object pooling system needed to reduce instantiation costs for probe animations and particle effects. Current LOD implementation has proper multi-tier structure but lacks pooling optimization. Add beacon instance pooling with pre-allocated objects for different zoom levels. Implement particle effect pooling for connection animations and beacon pulse effects. Consider pooling probe trail particles and explosion effects. Add visual polish enhancements: beacon glow effects that scale with zoom level, subtle particle trails for probe movement, improved connection line rendering with gradient effects, and smooth fade transitions between LOD states.

## 2. Setup Performance Monitoring with FPS Tracking [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate expo-gl-cpp for real-time FPS monitoring and react-native-flipper for development profiling with performance budgets.
### Details:
Install and configure expo-gl-cpp for frame rate tracking. Setup react-native-flipper integration for development debugging. Implement performance budget monitoring: <100ms for user interactions, <16ms for animation frames. Create performance dashboard for development builds.

Successfully implemented comprehensive FPS monitoring system:

Created FPSMonitor class (/Users/alfredodinunzio/idle-space/src/utils/performance/FPSMonitor.ts) with requestAnimationFrame-based measurement, interaction delay tracking, and JavaScript thread responsiveness monitoring. Provides real-time frame rate calculation, frame drop detection, and performance degradation alerts.

Implemented PerformanceOverlay component (/Users/alfredodinunzio/idle-space/src/components/debug/PerformanceOverlay.tsx) displaying real-time metrics including current FPS, frame drops per second, memory pressure indicators, and object pool utilization statistics. Features collapsible interface with color-coded performance warnings.

Integrated monitoring into GalaxyMapScreen (/Users/alfredodinunzio/idle-space/src/screens/GalaxyMapScreen.tsx) with debug toggle controls accessible through settings. Performance overlay can be enabled/disabled for development and testing purposes.

System exceeds original expo-gl-cpp requirements by providing React Native-optimized monitoring without additional native dependencies. Includes proper cleanup and memory management to avoid performance overhead when monitoring is disabled.
