# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Local Storage and Save System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create robust local data persistence using IndexedDB for game state and localStorage for settings with automatic backup and corruption recovery.
# Details:
Install expo-sqlite for structured data storage and @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for simple key-value pairs. Create SaveManager class with methods for saveGameState(), loadGameState(), createBackup(), and recoverFromCorruption(). Implement automatic save every 30 seconds using background timers. Create data schemas for Player, Beacon, Probe, and Galaxy entities. Add versioning system for save compatibility during updates. Implement compression for large save files using lz-string library.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for save/load operations. Test corruption recovery with malformed data. Verify automatic save intervals. Test large dataset performance (500+ beacons). Validate data migration between schema versions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup Storage Dependencies and Adapters [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure expo-sqlite and @react-native-async-storage/async-storage with basic connection setup and error handling.
### Details:
Install expo-sqlite for structured data storage and @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for simple key-value pairs. Configure database connections with proper error handling and connection pooling. Create basic storage adapter interfaces for both SQLite and AsyncStorage. Test basic read/write operations to ensure proper installation.

## 2. Create SaveManager Core Class [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the SaveManager class with fundamental save/load/backup methods and error handling.
### Details:
Create SaveManager class with core methods: saveGameState(), loadGameState(), createBackup(), and recoverFromCorruption(). Implement proper error handling for storage operations and corruption detection. Add data validation and sanitization for all save operations. Include logging for debugging save/load operations.

## 3. Design Data Schemas and Versioning System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create comprehensive data schemas for all game entities with version management and migration support.
### Details:
Design data schemas for Player, Beacon, Probe, and Galaxy entities using proper normalization. Implement versioning system for save compatibility during updates with migration scripts. Add schema validation to ensure data integrity. Create compression system using lz-string library for large save files. Include backwards compatibility for older save versions.

## 4. Implement Automatic Save System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create background timer system for automatic saves every 30 seconds with corruption detection and recovery.
### Details:
Implement automatic save system using background timers with 30-second intervals. Add corruption detection by validating save data integrity using checksums. Create automatic recovery system that falls back to previous valid saves. Implement save queue management to prevent concurrent save operations and ensure data consistency.

## 5. Testing and Performance Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Comprehensive testing of save system with large datasets, edge cases, and performance optimization.
### Details:
Create unit tests for save/load operations with various data sizes. Test corruption recovery with malformed data scenarios. Verify automatic save intervals and background operation reliability. Performance testing with large datasets (500+ beacons) and memory usage optimization. Validate data migration between schema versions and ensure mobile device compatibility.
