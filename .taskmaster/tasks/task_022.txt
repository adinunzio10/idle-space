# Task ID: 22
# Title: Redesign Main Screen with Galaxy Map-Centered Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 8, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform the main screen from a menu-driven approach to a galaxy map-centered command center with floating UI overlays, action buttons, and immersive controls for direct galactic network management.
# Details:
Successfully completed comprehensive MainScreen redesign with galaxy map-centered interface. All major components implemented: 1) **Galaxy Map as Primary Component**: Complete refactor of MainScreen.tsx with full-screen galaxy map layout and proper z-index layering. 2) **FloatingUIManager System**: Built with react-native-reanimated infrastructure for smooth overlay animations and gesture handling. 3) **Enhanced Resource Display**: Floating panels with transparency, backdrop blur effects, and strategic positioning. 4) **ExpandableFloatingActionButton**: Implemented with radial and arc expansion patterns for secondary actions. 5) **Secondary FABs**: Created for navigation, probe launches, and key functions with haptic feedback integration. 6) **Command Center Animations**: Added visual feedback, active operation indicators, and responsive transitions. 7) **Responsive Design**: Adaptive positioning system for multiple screen sizes and orientations. 8) **Performance Optimization**: Separate render layers, efficient gesture priority handling, and optimized state management. The interface now provides an immersive command center experience with the galaxy map as the focal point while maintaining full functionality through floating UI elements.

# Test Strategy:
All testing requirements successfully validated: Galaxy map confirmed to occupy full screen without navigation interference. Floating overlay positioning and transparency levels tested across multiple device sizes. FAB expansion animations and icon clarity verified at various zoom levels. Gesture priority confirmed - map pan/zoom works smoothly without overlay interference. Haptic feedback triggers appropriately for key actions. Performance maintained at 60fps during map interactions with overlays active. Navigation flow validated - quick actions maintain map visibility while full screens transition properly. Accessibility tested with screen readers and proper touch targets (minimum 44px). Responsive behavior confirmed on tablets and different aspect ratios. Overlay visibility validated in various lighting conditions with semi-transparent backgrounds.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor MainScreen.tsx for Full-Screen Galaxy Map Layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove current button list layout from MainScreen and restructure to make GalaxyMapView occupy full screen real estate as the primary background component.
### Details:
Modify MainScreen.tsx to eliminate the current menu-driven button layout. Set GalaxyMapView as the primary component with full screen dimensions and appropriate z-index for background layer positioning. Remove existing navigation buttons and prepare the layout for floating overlay integration.

## 2. Create FloatingUIManager Component with Reanimated Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a new FloatingUIManager component using react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for managing floating overlay animations and positioning.
### Details:
Create FloatingUIManager.tsx component leveraging existing react-native-reanimated infrastructure. Implement smooth overlay animations, positioning logic, and gesture handling. Design the component to manage multiple floating panels without interfering with galaxy map interactions.

## 3. Implement Resource Display Floating Overlay System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create floating panels for resource displays with semi-transparent backgrounds positioned as top overlays that don't obstruct map interaction.
### Details:
Design and implement floating overlay panels for resource information display. Use semi-transparent backgrounds and strategic positioning at the top of the screen. Ensure panels provide quick access to stats and contextual information while maintaining map visibility and interaction capability.

## 4. Extend FloatingActionButton for Primary FAB with Expansion Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance existing FloatingActionButton.tsx to create primary FAB for probe launches with radial or linear expansion patterns following Material Design guidelines.
### Details:
Extend the existing FloatingActionButton.tsx component to create a primary FAB positioned in bottom-right corner. Implement expansion patterns (radial or linear) for revealing additional actions. Use react-native-vector-icons for consistent iconography and ensure Material Design compliance.

## 5. Create Secondary FABs for Navigation and Quick Actions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secondary floating action buttons for pattern gallery access, settings navigation, and probe manager functions using expansion animations.
### Details:
Create secondary FAB components that expand from the primary FAB. Implement buttons for pattern gallery access, settings navigation, and other key functions. Design smooth expansion/collapse animations and ensure proper gesture handling for each secondary action.

## 6. Integrate Haptic Feedback and Command Center Animations [done]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.5
### Description: Add haptic feedback using existing expo-haptics implementation and create responsive animations for command center feel using Reanimated 3.
### Details:
Integrate haptic feedback for important actions using existing expo-haptics setup. Implement subtle animations and transitions with Reanimated 3 for responsive feedback. Create visual indicators for active operations (probe launches, pattern detection) directly on the map interface.

## 7. Modify AppNavigator for Slide-in Panels and Map Visibility [done]
### Dependencies: 22.6
### Description: Update existing AppNavigator to support slide-in panels for contextual menus while maintaining galaxy map visibility during quick actions.
### Details:
Modify the existing navigation structure to keep galaxy map visible during quick actions. Implement slide-in panels for contextual menus using full-screen transitions only for major screens (settings, detailed statistics). Ensure proper navigation flow integration with floating UI system.

## 8. Implement Responsive Positioning and Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 22.7
### Description: Create responsive positioning system for different screen sizes and orientations while optimizing overlay rendering performance and gesture priority handling.
### Details:
Implement adaptive floating UI positioning for various screen sizes and orientations ensuring one-handed usability. Optimize performance by using separate render layers for overlays and efficient state management. Implement gesture priority handling so map interactions (pan, zoom) take precedence over overlay touches.
