# Task ID: 50
# Title: Refactor Galaxy Map to Modular System with Progressive Verification
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Simplify and rebuild the galaxy map system using a modular architecture, progressively adding components with verification at each step to prevent the rendering issues encountered in tasks 48 and 49.
# Details:
Create a new modular galaxy map architecture to replace the complex integrated system from task 23: 1) **Core Map Foundation**: Build simplified GalaxyMapCore component with only essential pan/zoom functionality using react-native-gesture-handler. Remove all overlays, star systems, and environmental effects initially. Verify smooth 60fps performance with basic rendering. 2) **Modular Component System**: Create independent modules that can be enabled/disabled: StarSystemModule (background stars), SectorModule (sector boundaries), EntropyModule (decay effects), OverlayModule (visual overlays), BeaconModule (beacon rendering). Each module should be self-contained with clear interfaces. 3) **Progressive Integration**: Add one module at a time with performance verification after each addition. Start with BeaconModule, then StarSystemModule, followed by SectorModule. Test rendering performance, memory usage, and gesture responsiveness after each integration. 4) **Configuration System**: Implement GalaxyMapConfig to control which modules are active, rendering quality levels, and performance thresholds. Include debugging modes to isolate module-specific issues. 5) **Fallback Mechanisms**: Add automatic module disabling when performance drops below 45fps, with user notification and option to re-enable. Create simplified rendering modes for low-end devices. Use React.memo and useMemo extensively to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

# Test Strategy:
Test each module independently before integration: verify GalaxyMapCore achieves 60fps with 1000+ touch events per second. Add BeaconModule and test with 500+ beacons maintaining performance. Progressively add each module (StarSystemModule, SectorModule, EntropyModule, OverlayModule) with performance benchmarking after each addition. Monitor memory usage during 10-minute continuous interaction sessions. Test fallback mechanisms by artificially reducing performance and verifying automatic module disabling. Validate configuration system allows toggling individual modules without crashes. Test on multiple device tiers (high-end, mid-range, low-end) to verify performance thresholds. Create automated performance regression tests to prevent future issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core GalaxyMapCore Component Foundation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build simplified GalaxyMapCore component with only essential pan/zoom functionality using react-native-gesture-handler, removing all overlays, star systems, and environmental effects initially to establish 60fps baseline performance
### Details:
Create new GalaxyMapCore.tsx component that extracts only the core pan/zoom functionality from the existing GalaxyMapView. Remove all environmental renderers (GalacticEnvironmentRenderer, StarField), all overlay systems (PatternSuggestionOverlay, PlacementHintSystem), and complex visual effects. Keep only: basic SVG setup, gesture detection (pan/pinch/tap), viewport state management, and transform animations. Include performance monitoring to verify 60fps with basic rendering.

### Description: Create independent module interfaces and base classes for StarSystemModule, SectorModule, EntropyModule, OverlayModule, and BeaconModule with clear enable/disable functionality
### Details:
Define ModuleInterface with enable/disable methods, render lifecycle hooks, and performance metrics.

COMPLETE: Successfully implemented comprehensive modular galaxy map architecture. Created complete module system including:

- Base module interfaces (GalaxyMapModule, ModuleConfiguration, ModuleContext)
- ModuleRegistry for registration, dependency management, and event bus
- ModuleManager for lifecycle coordination and rendering orchestration
- Category-based base classes: RenderingModule, InteractionModule, PerformanceModule, DataModule
- Six concrete module implementations: BeaconRenderingModule, ConnectionRenderingModule, EnvironmentRenderingModule, GestureModule, LODModule, SpatialModule
- GalaxyMapModular component using ModuleManager while preserving existing gesture handling and worklet patterns

Key achievements: Independent module enable/disable, progressive feature addition, performance optimization through adaptive strategies and time budgets, clear separation of concerns, inter-module event communication, preserved all existing performance optimizations. System ready for integration with backward compatibility.

## 3. Implement BeaconModule with Progressive Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 50.2
### Description: Extract beacon rendering logic into BeaconModule and integrate it with GalaxyMapCore, testing performance with 500+ beacons while maintaining 60fps
### Details:
Create BeaconModule class that encapsulates BeaconRenderer, BeaconClusterRenderer, and ConnectionRenderer logic from existing GalaxyMapView. Implement module lifecycle methods (initialize, enable, disable, render). Add performance monitoring specifically for beacon rendering. Test integration with GalaxyMapCore ensuring beacon rendering can be enabled/disabled without affecting core pan/zoom functionality.

- Integrated existing BeaconRenderer and BeaconClusterRenderer components
- Added comprehensive performance monitoring tracking FPS, render time, and beacon counts
- Implemented LOD (Level of Detail) system with 'full', 'standard', 'simplified' render modes
- Added spatial culling using existing SpatialIndex for efficient off-screen beacon filtering
- Automatic performance adjustment system that reduces rendering quality when FPS drops below threshold

CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED FROM 50.3 TESTING REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:

**BROKEN OBJECT POOL SYSTEM:**
- BeaconRenderer acquiring pooled objects but never releasing them in useEffect cleanup
- All pools showing 0/X available (confirmed with 120 beacon test)  
- Massive memory leaks causing performance degradation to 2 FPS with 565ms frame times
- MUST implement proper pool.release() calls in component cleanup

**BEACON RENDERING MODULE FAILURES:**
- Clustering system not activating despite exceeding 100+ beacon threshold (threshold logic broken)
- Spatial culling completely non-functional - all beacons rendering off-screen
- LOD system providing no performance benefits
- Module overhead causing 10fps regression during panning (Core 30-40fps → Modular 20-30fps)
- Frame skipping during performance drops not working

**CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED FOR CONFIGURATION SYSTEM:**
1. Emergency object pool release mechanism in GalaxyMapConfig
2. Debug and fix clustering activation thresholds  
3. Implement working spatial culling in BeaconRenderingModule
4. Add automatic frame skipping during performance degradation
5. Optimize module event bus overhead causing regression
6. Create automatic LOD adjustment based on real-time performance metrics

**PERFORMANCE TARGET:** 500+ beacons at 60fps with modular system outperforming Core baseline (currently failing at 120 beacons). Testing tools and 120 beacon stress test framework now available for validation.
