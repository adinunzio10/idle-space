# Title: Debug ProbeManagerFab Missing Logs and Button Rendering Issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate and fix the ProbeManagerFab component where logs are not displaying and the floating action button is not rendering properly in the probe management interface.
# Details:
Debug the ProbeManagerFab component by investigating multiple potential issues: 1) **Button Rendering Problems**: Check if the floating action button component is properly imported and configured. Verify React Native styling is correctly applied and not being overridden. Investigate if the button is being rendered but positioned off-screen or with zero opacity. Check for any conditional rendering logic that might be preventing display. 2) **Logging Issues**: Examine console.log statements or logging framework integration to determine why probe-related logs are not appearing. Verify logging level configuration and ensure debug logs are enabled in development mode. Check if logs are being filtered or suppressed by React Native Metro bundler or development tools. 3) **Component State Issues**: Investigate if the component is mounting correctly and receiving proper props from parent components. Check for any state management issues that might affect rendering. Verify the component lifecycle methods are executing as expected. 4) **Integration Problems**: Ensure ProbeManagerFab is properly integrated with the overall probe management system and state. Check for any missing dependencies or import statements that could cause silent failures.

# Test Strategy:
Systematically test each potential failure point: 1) Add console.log statements at component mount, render, and key lifecycle points to verify execution flow. 2) Use React Native debugging tools to inspect component hierarchy and verify ProbeManagerFab is in the render tree. 3) Test button rendering by temporarily adding simple styling overrides to ensure visibility. 4) Verify logging configuration by testing console.log statements in other components. 5) Check network debugging tools to ensure probe-related API calls are working. 6) Test component in isolation by creating a minimal reproduction case. 7) Validate all imports and dependencies are correctly resolved.
