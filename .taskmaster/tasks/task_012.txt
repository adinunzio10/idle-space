# Task ID: 12
# Title: Research and Implement Industry-Standard Mobile Gesture System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Research and implement production-grade gesture handling system for React Native galaxy map that resolves tap/pan conflicts, improves gesture recognition accuracy, and provides foundation for precise beacon placement interactions.
# Details:
Research React Native Gesture Handler v2+ best practices from major mobile apps (Google Maps, Apple Maps) focusing on gesture state machines and conflict resolution. Implement proper gesture hierarchy: simultaneous recognizers for pinch+pan, tap gesture with failure requirements on pan/pinch. Configure gesture thresholds based on research: minimum pan distance 10px, tap max duration 200ms, velocity smoothing using exponential moving average with 0.2 alpha factor. Create gesture worklets for 60fps performance using react-native-reanimated worklets for all gesture callbacks. Implement momentum physics with velocity threshold >150px/s and deceleration factor 0.95. Add gesture debugging tools including visual feedback overlays and gesture state logging. Configure platform-specific optimizations: iOS UIGestureRecognizer integration and Android MotionEvent handling. Implement palm rejection using touch area analysis and multi-touch filtering. Create gesture configuration system supporting different device profiles and accessibility settings. Add comprehensive gesture testing suite with synthetic touch events and performance monitoring. Ensure proper gesture handler composition preventing conflicts between map navigation and future beacon placement functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test gesture recognition accuracy across device sizes and touch sensitivities. Verify tap/pan conflict resolution with rapid gesture transitions. Test momentum physics with various velocity patterns and finger lift scenarios. Performance test 60fps gesture response under heavy rendering load. Test palm rejection and accidental touch filtering. Validate cross-platform consistency between iOS and Android. Test accessibility support with different system settings. Create automated gesture testing with synthetic touch events. Stress test with complex multi-finger scenarios and rapid gesture sequences. Verify worklet performance and UI thread responsiveness during intensive gesture interactions.

Research phase completed with comprehensive analysis of current GalaxyMapView gesture implementation and industry standards comparison. Current implementation rated 8.5/10 with modern React Native Gesture Handler v2 architecture, proper UI thread worklets, sophisticated momentum physics, and elastic boundaries. Key findings: already implements industry best practices including gesture composition with Race/Exclusive patterns, velocity smoothing to prevent finger-lift artifacts, and proper worklet usage. Areas identified for improvement include adaptive gesture thresholds (currently fixed values), velocity-aware pinch handling, and enhanced accessibility features. Google Maps and Apple Maps research revealed 2024-2025 focus on adaptive behavior and cross-platform consistency. Ready to proceed to Task 12.2 optimization phase with specific recommendations: implement context-aware thresholds, add pinch velocity handling, enhance state machine with explicit states, improve boundary conflict resolution, and add accessibility enhancements like haptics and zoom-based touch targets.

## 2. Optimize Gesture Thresholds and Configuration System [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement optimized gesture thresholds and create configurable gesture system based on research findings.
### Details:
Configure gesture thresholds based on research: minimum pan distance 10px, tap max duration 200ms, velocity smoothing using exponential moving average with 0.2 alpha factor. Implement gesture configuration system supporting different device profiles and accessibility settings.

Currently analyzing existing gesture system architecture in GalaxyMapView.tsx and viewport.ts utilities to identify integration points for optimized thresholds. Found current gesture implementation uses basic React Native Gesture Handler setup without configuration management. Planning modular gesture configuration architecture: GestureConfig module with device-specific profiles, threshold constants (10px pan minimum, 200ms tap maximum, 0.2 EMA alpha), and accessibility overrides. Next steps: extract current gesture logic into configurable system, implement palm rejection using touch area analysis, add platform-specific optimizations for iOS/Android gesture handling differences.
