# Task ID: 26
# Title: Create Galaxy Sector System with Star System States and Entropy Mechanics
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a galaxy sector system that divides the map into regions containing star systems with health states (healthy, dying, dead) and entropy spread mechanics between sectors over time.
# Details:
Create GalaxySectorManager class to divide the galaxy map into hexagonal sectors using axial coordinate system. Implement StarSystem class with three states: Healthy (neutral, no special resources), Dying (harvestable for Stellar Essence, visual decay effects), Dead (source of Void Fragments, dark visual state). Create SectorGrid using spatial hashing for efficient sector lookup and neighbor detection. Implement EntropySystem with spreading mechanics: entropy increases in sectors over time, spreads to adjacent sectors at configurable rates, beacon networks within range provide entropy resistance. Add sector-level resource generation modifiers based on star system states within each sector. Create visual sector boundaries using react-native-svg with color coding for entropy levels. Implement SectorDecayManager with time-based progression: healthy systems decay to dying over time periods, dying systems become dead without intervention, entropy spreads faster in sectors with more dead systems. Add BeaconNetworkProtection algorithm that calculates entropy resistance based on beacon density and connection strength within sector influence ranges. Create sector state persistence in save system with entropy progression tracking. Implement visual feedback showing entropy spread with particle effects and color gradients between sectors.

# Test Strategy:
Test sector grid generation and coordinate system accuracy across different galaxy sizes. Verify star system state transitions with time-based decay mechanics and entropy calculations. Test entropy spreading between adjacent sectors with various beacon network configurations. Validate beacon network protection calculations against entropy in different sector layouts. Performance testing with large numbers of sectors and concurrent entropy calculations. Test sector state persistence and loading with complex entropy states. Verify visual rendering of sector boundaries and entropy effects at different zoom levels.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GalaxySectorManager class with Voronoi-based sector division [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the main GalaxySectorManager class that creates hexagonal galactic sectors using Voronoi diagrams and manages sector spatial indexing for efficient neighbor detection and entropy spreading.
### Details:
Build upon the existing SectorManager.ts and integrate it as the core GalaxySectorManager. Extend the current Voronoi generation to support hexagonal sector approximation using the existing VoronoiGenerator class. Implement spatial hashing for efficient sector lookup during gameplay. Add methods for sector-to-sector neighbor detection using the existing neighboringSectors arrays. Include sector bounds calculation and point-in-polygon testing for star system assignment. Use the existing SeededRandom class for deterministic generation that matches the current architecture.
<info added on 2025-09-03T01:39:26.440Z>
Codebase examination confirmed - existing SectorManager.ts already provides complete GalaxySectorManager functionality with VoronoiGenerator class implementing Voronoi-based sector division, grid approximation, relaxation iterations, and neighbor detection. No additional implementation needed as core spatial indexing and sector management systems are already operational and integrated into the galaxy architecture.

## 2. Implement StarSystem class with three health states and resource generation [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive StarSystem class that manages the three states (healthy, dying, dead) with appropriate visual properties, resource generation rates, and state transition mechanics over time.
### Details:
Extend the existing StarSystem interface in galaxy.ts into a full class implementation. Add methods for state transitions: healthy->dying->dead progression based on entropy levels. Implement resource generation: Stellar Essence for dying stars (10-50 units), Void Fragments for dead stars (5-25 units), no resources for healthy stars. Add visual properties: brightness values (healthy: 0.4-0.8, dying: 0.7-1.0, dead: 0.1-0.3), radius scaling, and decay animations. Integrate with the existing entropy system from EntropySpreadManager.ts for automatic state progression. Use the existing updateStarSystemStates function as a foundation.

Implementation successfully completed with full StarSystem class in galaxy.ts featuring health state management (healthy, dying, dead) with entropy-based transitions, resource generation rates (Stellar Essence for dying: 10-50 units, Void Fragments for dead: 5-25 units), and visual properties including brightness scaling and decay animations. React component created in StarSystem.tsx with state-specific rendering, color themes, and resource indicators. All entropy tracking and visual feedback systems fully integrated and functional.

## 3. Create SectorGrid with spatial hashing for efficient sector operations [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1, 26.2
### Description: Implement a high-performance SectorGrid system using spatial hashing for rapid sector lookup, neighbor detection, and viewport-based rendering optimizations.
### Details:
Create SectorGrid class that wraps the existing SectorManager functionality with spatial hash optimization. Implement grid-based indexing where each grid cell contains references to sectors that intersect it. Add efficient getSectorsInViewport() method for rendering optimization. Implement fast findSectorContaining(point) using spatial hash instead of iterating all sectors. Add updateSectorGrid() method for dynamic sector boundary changes. Use configurable grid resolution based on average sector size. Integrate with existing viewport state management from GalaxyMapView.tsx.

Based on the provided context, here's the new information that should be appended to the subtask details:

Implementation completed - SectorManager.ts now contains all required SectorGrid functionality including spatial hashing optimization, getSectorContaining() method for efficient point-to-sector lookups, neighbor sector detection algorithms, and sector bounds intersection checking. All spatial operations have been implemented and are fully functional, eliminating the need for a separate SectorGrid class wrapper.

## 4. Integrate EntropySystem with beacon network resistance calculations [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3
### Description: Enhance the existing EntropySpreadManager to include beacon network protection mechanics that provide entropy resistance based on beacon density and connection strength within sector ranges.
### Details:
Extend the existing EntropySpreadManager.ts with beacon network resistance logic. Add BeaconNetworkProtection algorithm that calculates entropy resistance based on beacon count per sector, connection strength between beacons, and network coverage density. Implement resistance calculation: base resistance = (beacon_count * 0.1), connection bonus = (avg_connection_strength * 0.05), coverage bonus = (network_coverage * 0.1). Add entropy reduction mechanics where sectors with high beacon resistance decay entropy faster. Integrate with existing cellular automata rules by adding new high-priority rules for beacon protection. Use existing beacon data structures from Task 5 implementation.
<info added on 2025-09-03T01:40:21.037Z>
Implementation complete and functional with full cellular automata system integration. BeaconNetworkProtection algorithm successfully calculates entropy resistance using beacon count (0.1x multiplier), connection strength (0.05x multiplier), and network coverage (0.1x multiplier). Entropy spreading mechanics working between sectors with automatic state progression from healthy to dying to dead based on entropy thresholds. High-priority beacon protection rules integrated with existing cellular automata, providing faster entropy decay in well-protected sectors. All beacon density calculations and sector influence ranges properly connected to existing Task 5 beacon data structures.
