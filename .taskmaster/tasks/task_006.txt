# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Probe Launch and Automation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create automated probe deployment system with three distinct probe types and manual launch acceleration for strategic expansion.
# Details:
Implement ProbeManager with three types: Pioneer (fast deployment, 30s), Harvester (slow, 90s, +50% Stellar Essence), Architect (medium, 60s, +100% connection range). Create auto-launch timer system using expo-task-manager for background processing. Add manual launch acceleration providing 2x speed bonus. Implement probe queue system allowing multiple launches with resource costs: Pioneer (100 Quantum Data), Harvester (50 Quantum Data + 10 Stellar Essence), Architect (200 Quantum Data). Add visual probe travel animation using react-native-reanimated shared values. Include launch capacity upgrades through progression system.

# Test Strategy:
Test automated launch timing accuracy. Verify manual acceleration bonuses. Test probe queue management with resource validation. Performance testing with multiple simultaneous probe launches.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement ProbeManager Class with Three Probe Types [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create ProbeManager class with Pioneer, Harvester, and Architect probe types, each with distinct deployment times, costs, and bonuses
### Details:
Implement ProbeManager class with three probe types: Pioneer (30s deployment, 100 Quantum Data cost, fast expansion), Harvester (90s deployment, 50 Quantum Data + 10 Stellar Essence cost, +50% Stellar Essence bonus), Architect (60s deployment, 200 Quantum Data cost, +100% connection range). Define probe properties, launch validation, and completion callbacks.

Implementation completed successfully. Created comprehensive ProbeManager class at src/core/ProbeManager.ts with all three probe types implementing correct deployment times, resource costs, and bonuses. Added complete type definitions at src/types/probe.ts including ProbeType enum, probe configurations, and utility functions. Integrated ProbeManager with GameController using singleton pattern, implemented resource validation system, probe launch queue, and manual acceleration feature with 2x speed bonus. All TypeScript type checking passes with no errors and ESLint warnings have been resolved.

## 2. Create Automated Launch Timer System with Background Processing [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement automated probe launch system using expo-task-manager for background processing and queue management
### Details:
Integrate expo-task-manager for background task processing. Create automated launch timer system that continues probe deployments when app is backgrounded. Implement probe queue system allowing multiple simultaneous launches. Add launch scheduling and completion handling with persistent state management.
<info added on 2025-08-26T04:29:16.786Z>
Implementation completed: Created ProbeBackgroundService.ts with AsyncStorage for persistent state management across app sessions. Enhanced ProbeManager to support up to 3 concurrent probe launches with automatic queue processing running every second. Integrated expo-task-manager package for true background execution when app is backgrounded or closed. Added background state synchronization ensuring offline probe completions are properly processed on app resume. All probe launches now validate resources automatically and maintain proper status tracking throughout the launch cycle. System maintains TypeScript strict compliance and follows existing code patterns.

## 3. Add Manual Launch Acceleration with Speed Bonus [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement manual launch acceleration providing 2x speed bonus with visual feedback and user interaction
### Details:
Create manual acceleration system allowing players to tap/hold for 2x launch speed bonus. Add visual feedback showing acceleration state and progress. Implement acceleration cost/limitation mechanics. Include haptic feedback and visual indicators for enhanced user experience during manual acceleration.

## 4. Implement Probe Travel Animation System [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create visual probe travel animations using react-native-reanimated shared values with smooth trajectory rendering
### Details:
Implement probe travel animations using react-native-reanimated shared values for smooth 60fps animations. Create trajectory path calculation from launch point to target beacon. Add animated probe icons with travel progress indicators. Include arrival animations and visual effects for successful probe deployment completion.
