# Task ID: 68
# Title: Create Random Discovery Notification UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 29, 41, 43
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement comprehensive frontend components for the discovery system including notification modals, collection screens, progress tracking, and celebration animations using React Native and NativeWind styling.
# Details:
Create comprehensive DiscoveryUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **DiscoveryNotificationModal Component**: Implement modal dialog using react-native-modal with dark space theme styling, featuring discovery animation sequence with particle effects using react-native-reanimated, congratulations messaging with discovery title and description, discovery icon with glow effects, and bonus preview showing gained benefits. Include haptic feedback using expo-haptics and auto-dismiss after 5 seconds. 2) **DiscoveryCollectionScreen Component**: Create scrollable collection interface using ScrollView with grid layout, displaying all discovered bonuses organized by category (geometric patterns, operational improvements, resource generation, meta-progression). Each discovery card shows icon, name, description, unlock date, and bonus details with locked/unlocked visual states. 3) **DiscoveryCounter Component**: Implement compact progress indicator for main UI showing collected/total discoveries ratio (e.g., "12/45 Discoveries") with animated progress bar and category breakdown on tap. 4) **DiscoveryGlowEffect Component**: Create subtle glow animation wrapper for recently acquired discoveries using Animated.Value with pulsing opacity and scale effects lasting 24 hours after unlock. 5) **DiscoveryStatsDisplay Component**: Build statistics screen showing discovery progress by category, unlock timeline, completion percentages, and rarest discoveries with achievement integration. Use NativeWind classes for consistent dark space theme with quantum-themed gradients, borders, and typography. Integrate with Chronos Particles system for discovery celebration rewards.

# Test Strategy:
Test DiscoveryNotificationModal rendering with various discovery types and verify animation timing, haptic feedback trigger, and auto-dismiss functionality. Validate DiscoveryCollectionScreen by populating with mock discovery data across all categories, testing grid layout responsiveness and locked/unlocked state visual differences. Test DiscoveryCounter accuracy by comparing displayed ratios with actual discovery counts and verify category breakdown modal functionality. Validate DiscoveryGlowEffect animation by triggering recent discoveries and confirming 24-hour glow duration with proper fade-out timing. Test DiscoveryStatsDisplay data visualization accuracy and verify integration with achievement system for discovery-based rewards.
