# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Pattern Suggestion System Performance in Galaxy Map
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the pattern suggestion system for connected beacons to provide real-time visual hints while maintaining 60fps performance during shape completion interactions.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations for the pattern suggestion system building on the existing geometric pattern detection (Task 7). Key optimizations: 1) Implement spatial indexing using R-tree data structure to reduce computational complexity from O(n²) to O(log n) for nearby beacon queries. 2) Add debounced pattern calculation triggered only on significant map changes (zoom >10%, pan >screen width/4) using lodash.debounce with 100ms delay. 3) Implement incremental pattern validation - only recalculate patterns for beacons within interaction radius rather than full map recalculation. 4) Add pattern suggestion caching with LRU eviction (max 50 cached patterns) to avoid redundant calculations. 5) Use React.memo and useMemo for PatternSuggestion component to prevent unnecessary re-renders. 6) Implement viewport culling - only suggest patterns for beacons visible in current viewport plus 20% buffer zone. 7) Add WebWorker support for complex pattern calculations on web platform to prevent main thread blocking. 8) Optimize suggestion rendering using react-native-svg with shouldComponentUpdate for suggestion overlays. 9) Implement progressive pattern complexity - show simple triangle/square suggestions first, then pentagon/hexagon suggestions after 200ms delay. 10) Add performance monitoring with expo-perf-monitor to track pattern calculation timing and suggest system responsiveness.

# Test Strategy:
Performance testing with 500+ beacons measuring pattern suggestion latency (<50ms target). Frame rate monitoring during active pattern completion maintaining 60fps. Memory usage profiling with suggestion caching under heavy load. User experience testing for suggestion responsiveness during rapid map navigation. A/B testing comparing optimized vs unoptimized suggestion performance. Stress testing with complex overlapping patterns and rapid beacon placement sequences. Cross-platform performance validation on iOS, Android, and web platforms.
