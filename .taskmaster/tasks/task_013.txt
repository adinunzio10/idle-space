# Task ID: 13
# Title: Debug and Fix React Native Reanimated JSI Crashes in Galaxy Map
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate and resolve React Native Reanimated crashes occurring in galaxy map gesture handling, specifically JSI crashes in worklet execution and RNBetterPanGestureRecognizer context violations.
# Details:
Debug the specific crash at facebook::jsi::Function::getHostFunction by analyzing worklet boundary violations in gesture handlers. Investigate worklet context isolation issues where JavaScript objects are being improperly serialized across worklet boundaries. Common causes include: SharedValue objects containing non-serializable JavaScript Map/Set objects, React state being accessed directly in worklets, gesture callbacks trying to call non-worklet functions synchronously. Fix by: replacing JavaScript Map objects with plain objects or arrays in SharedValue contexts, ensuring all gesture handler callbacks are properly marked as worklets or wrapped with runOnJS(), implementing proper error boundaries around worklet execution, adding worklet context validation to prevent cross-boundary violations. Use React Native Flipper and Chrome DevTools to trace worklet execution flow and identify memory leaks. Add comprehensive logging to gesture state machine transitions to isolate crash triggers.

# Test Strategy:
Reproduce crash scenarios with rapid gesture combinations on galaxy map. Test gesture handlers under memory pressure and rapid state changes. Verify worklet execution stability with device rotation and app backgrounding. Use React Native debugging tools to monitor worklet memory usage and garbage collection. Test on both iOS and Android with debug/release builds. Create automated stress tests for gesture recognition with concurrent animations.

# Subtasks:

## 2. Identify and Fix SharedValue Serialization Issues with Map/Set Objects [cancelled]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Audit SharedValue usage to find non-serializable JavaScript Map/Set objects causing worklet boundary violations.
### Details:
Scan codebase for SharedValue objects containing JavaScript Map, Set, or other non-serializable objects. Replace Map objects with plain objects or arrays in SharedValue contexts. Implement serialization validation for SharedValue assignments. Add runtime checks to prevent non-serializable data from crossing worklet boundaries.

**Implementation Completed:**

Successfully resolved SharedValue serialization issues that were causing JSI crashes at worklet boundaries. Key fixes implemented:

1. **Gesture State Refactoring**: Replaced complex gestureState object with individual primitive SharedValues (isActive, scale, translateX, translateY) to ensure worklet serialization compatibility.

2. **Touch Tracking Serialization**: Converted activeTouchAreas from Map object to JSON string storage in SharedValue, preventing non-serializable object crossing worklet boundaries.

3. **Data Structure Migration**: Eliminated all Map and Set objects from SharedValue contexts, replacing with primitive values and serializable alternatives.

4. **Runtime Validation**: Added serialization checks to prevent future violations when assigning complex objects to SharedValues.

These changes directly address the facebook::jsi::Function::getHostFunction crash by ensuring all data crossing worklet boundaries is properly serializable. The galaxy map gesture handling should now operate without JSI crashes during pan, zoom, and touch interactions.

## 3. Fix Gesture Handler Worklet Boundary Violations with runOnJS Wrapping [cancelled]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Ensure all gesture handler callbacks properly use runOnJS() for JavaScript thread operations or are marked as worklets.
### Details:
Audit all gesture handlers in galaxy map for synchronous JavaScript calls. Wrap non-worklet function calls with runOnJS() in gesture callbacks. Mark appropriate functions with 'worklet' directive for UI thread execution. Fix RNBetterPanGestureRecognizer context violations by ensuring proper worklet context isolation.

## 4. Debug State Machine Integration for React State Access in Worklets [cancelled]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Resolve issues where worklets attempt to directly access React state, causing JSI crashes and context violations.
### Details:
Identify locations where worklets access React state directly. Implement proper state sharing mechanisms using SharedValue for worklet-accessible state. Add error boundaries around worklet execution to catch state access violations. Ensure gesture state machine transitions don't violate worklet context rules.

## 5. Implement Memory Leak Prevention and Comprehensive Cross-Platform Testing [cancelled]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Add comprehensive logging, prevent memory leaks, and test fixes across iOS/Android with stress tests for gesture combinations.
### Details:
Implement comprehensive logging for gesture state machine transitions to isolate crash triggers. Add memory leak detection and cleanup for worklet contexts. Create stress tests with rapid gesture combinations, device rotation, and app backgrounding. Test on both iOS and Android with release builds. Monitor worklet memory usage and garbage collection patterns.
