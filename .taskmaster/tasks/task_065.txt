# Task ID: 65
# Title: Create Beacon Milestone Choice UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 41, 40
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement frontend components for the binary upgrade choice system including milestone choice modals, progress displays, selection interfaces, and confirmation dialogs using React Native and NativeWind styling.
# Details:
Create comprehensive MilestoneChoiceUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **MilestoneChoiceModal Component**: Implement modal dialog using react-native-modal with dark space theme styling, featuring two mutually exclusive upgrade path cards with titles, descriptions, benefits preview, and visual icons. Include binary choice selection using TouchableOpacity with haptic feedback and confirmation requirement before applying permanent upgrade. Use NativeWind classes for quantum-themed gradients and space aesthetics. 2) **MilestoneProgressBar Component**: Create progress tracking display using react-native-progress with custom styling, showing current beacon count toward next milestone target (e.g., '47/50 Beacons'), percentage completion, and estimated time to milestone. Include animated progress updates and milestone threshold markers. 3) **BinaryChoiceCard Component**: Design upgrade option cards with clear visual hierarchy showing choice title, detailed benefit description, resource impact preview, and selection state indicator. Use conditional styling for selected/unselected states with smooth transitions. 4) **MilestoneHistorySection Component**: Implement scrollable list of previous milestone decisions using FlatList, displaying choice made, benefits gained, beacon count at time of choice, and timestamp. Include search/filter functionality for milestone review. 5) **UpcomingMilestonePreview Component**: Create preview display showing next milestone target, required beacon count, and potential upgrade choices with locked/teaser styling. 6) **PermanentChoiceConfirmation Component**: Implement final confirmation dialog with warning text about permanent nature of choice, upgrade summary, and double-confirmation requirement to prevent accidental selections.

# Test Strategy:
Test MilestoneChoiceModal rendering with various milestone scenarios and verify binary choice selection logic prevents multiple selections while allowing choice changes before confirmation. Validate MilestoneProgressBar accuracy by testing with different beacon counts and verifying progress calculations match actual game state. Test BinaryChoiceCard visual states and animations during selection changes, confirming proper styling transitions and haptic feedback responsiveness. Validate MilestoneHistorySection performance with large datasets of previous choices and test search functionality with various filter criteria. Test UpcomingMilestonePreview with different game progression states to ensure accurate milestone targets and choice previews. Verify PermanentChoiceConfirmation prevents accidental selections through double-confirmation flow and test integration with beacon upgrade system to ensure choices apply correctly to game state.
