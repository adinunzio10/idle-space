# Task ID: 73
# Title: Create Hierarchical Pattern Discovery UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 41, 60, 68, 45
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement comprehensive frontend components for the complex pattern discovery system including celebration effects, pattern library UI, suggestion displays, progress tracking, and discovery animations.
# Details:
Create comprehensive PatternDiscoveryUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **PatternDiscoveryModal Component**: Implement celebration modal using react-native-modal with particle system animations using react-native-reanimated, featuring discovery title with tier indicator, complexity progression visualization, earned rewards display, and auto-dismiss with haptic feedback. Include tier-based color schemes (bronze/silver/gold/quantum). 2) **PatternLibraryScreen Component**: Create scrollable library using FlatList with hierarchical tier sections (Basic Triangles, Advanced Polygons, Complex Formations, Quantum Structures), pattern cards showing completion status, complexity ratings, unlock requirements, and tap-to-view details. Use NativeWind dark space theme with tier-based accent colors. 3) **PatternSuggestionOverlay Component**: Implement context-aware hint system using Animated.View positioning over galaxy map, showing suggested beacon placements with dotted connection previews, completion percentage indicators, and dismissible hint cards with pattern formation guidance. 4) **PatternProgressTracker Component**: Create progress visualization using react-native-progress with multi-tier progress bars, pattern completion statistics, tier unlock countdowns, and achievement milestone indicators. 5) **PatternDatabaseBrowser Component**: Implement searchable/filterable database using TextInput for search, Picker for tier filtering, completion status toggles, and grid layout for pattern cards with thumbnail previews. 6) **DiscoveryUnlockAnimation Component**: Create sophisticated unlock sequences using react-native-reanimated with scale/opacity transitions, particle bursts, tier achievement celebrations, and chained animations for multiple discoveries. Include proper cleanup and performance optimization for complex animations.

# Test Strategy:
Test PatternDiscoveryModal rendering with various tier discoveries and verify particle animation performance, haptic feedback timing, and proper tier color schemes. Validate PatternLibraryScreen by populating with mock pattern data across all tiers, testing scrolling performance with 100+ patterns and verifying hierarchical organization. Test PatternSuggestionOverlay positioning accuracy over galaxy map coordinates and confirm context-aware suggestions update correctly based on current beacon placement. Validate PatternProgressTracker calculations by testing with various completion percentages and tier progression scenarios. Test PatternDatabaseBrowser search/filter functionality with edge cases like empty results, special characters, and filter combinations. Performance test DiscoveryUnlockAnimation with rapid consecutive discoveries and verify smooth animation chaining without memory leaks.
