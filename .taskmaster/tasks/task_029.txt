# Task ID: 29
# Title: Create Achievement System with Milestone Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive backend achievement system that tracks player accomplishments across beacon counts, patterns discovered, resources generated, and special events, rewarding Chronos Particles and unlocking titles or visual effects through pure business logic and data persistence.
# Details:
Develop backend AchievementManager class with persistent tracking system using SQLite storage for achievement progress. Create achievement categories: 1) **Beacon Milestones**: Track total beacons placed (10, 50, 100, 500, 1000+), beacons upgraded, specializations chosen. 2) **Pattern Discovery**: Track unique geometric patterns found (first triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon), pattern variations, overlapping patterns created. 3) **Resource Generation**: Monitor cumulative Quantum Data, Stellar Essence, Void Fragments generated with tiered thresholds (1K, 10K, 100K, 1M+). 4) **Special Events**: Track Quantum Leaps performed, Echo Beacons placed, dying stars saved, entropy reversals achieved. Implement AchievementTracker with event-driven updates using React Native EventEmitter to monitor game actions. Create reward system calculations: achievements grant 5-50 Chronos Particles based on difficulty, unlock player titles ('Network Pioneer', 'Pattern Master', 'Quantum Architect'), and visual effects (beacon auras, special connection colors, galaxy map themes). Implement completion percentage tracking logic for multi-tiered achievements (e.g., 'Place 1000 beacons' calculates 45.6% at 456 beacons). Use AsyncStorage for achievement persistence and sync with main save system. Focus exclusively on business logic, data persistence, achievement calculation algorithms, and reward distribution without any frontend components.

# Test Strategy:
Test achievement triggering accuracy across all categories with simulated game actions (beacon placement, pattern formation, resource generation). Verify progress persistence across app restarts and device changes through AsyncStorage and SQLite integration. Test reward calculation algorithms ensuring Chronos Particles are correctly computed and titles/visual effects are properly unlocked in data layer. Validate achievement completion percentage calculations with edge cases and boundary conditions. Test performance impact of continuous progress tracking during intensive gameplay sessions. Verify achievement data integrity during save/load operations and prestige resets. Test EventEmitter integration for real-time achievement progress updates without UI dependencies.
