# Title: Create Audio System Settings UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 41, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement comprehensive frontend components for the audio system including volume controls, audio quality settings, haptic feedback sync, music track selection, and accessibility-compliant audio controls using React Native and NativeWind styling.
# Details:
Create comprehensive AudioSettingsUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **AudioSettingsScreen Component**: Implement main settings screen using ScrollView with NativeWind dark space theme styling, featuring organized sections for volume controls, audio quality, and preferences. Include proper header with back navigation and settings icon. 2) **VolumeControlSlider Component**: Create custom slider components for master, music, and effects volumes using react-native-slider with custom thumb and track styling. Include real-time audio preview during adjustment, percentage display labels, and mute toggle buttons with haptic feedback using expo-haptics. Implement volume curve calculations for proper audio scaling. 3) **AudioQualitySelector Component**: Design dropdown/picker interface for audio quality selection (Low/Medium/High/Ultra) with bitrate information display and storage impact warnings. Use TouchableOpacity with modal picker for selection. 4) **HapticSyncToggle Component**: Implement toggle switches for haptic feedback synchronization with audio events using Switch component with custom styling. Include separate toggles for UI sounds, gameplay feedback, and notification vibrations. 5) **MusicTrackSelector Component**: Create scrollable track selection interface with preview playback functionality, track duration display, album artwork placeholders, and currently playing indicator. Include shuffle and loop mode toggles. 6) **SoundEffectPreview Component**: Implement preview buttons for each sound effect category (UI, gameplay, notifications) with play/stop states and volume level indicators. Use TouchableOpacity with audio feedback. 7) **AudioDuckingControls Component**: Create sensitivity slider for audio ducking during notifications with test button and explanation text. Include automatic ducking toggle and recovery time settings. 8) **AudioTroubleshooting Component**: Design expandable troubleshooting section with common audio issues, reset options, device compatibility checks, and audio driver information display. Use Animated views for expand/collapse functionality. All components must follow accessibility guidelines with proper labels, hints, and screen reader support using accessibility props.

# Test Strategy:
Test AudioSettingsScreen rendering with all audio components and verify proper section organization, scrolling behavior, and dark theme styling consistency. Validate VolumeControlSlider functionality by adjusting sliders and confirming real-time audio preview, percentage calculations, and mute toggle synchronization with haptic feedback. Test AudioQualitySelector by cycling through all quality options and verifying storage impact calculations and bitrate displays. Validate HapticSyncToggle components by enabling/disabling toggles and confirming haptic feedback changes in other app areas. Test MusicTrackSelector by selecting different tracks, using preview playback, and verifying currently playing indicators update correctly. Validate SoundEffectPreview buttons by triggering each sound category and confirming proper play/stop state management and volume level responses. Test AudioDuckingControls sensitivity adjustments with mock notifications and measure ducking response times and recovery behavior. Verify AudioTroubleshooting section expansion/collapse animations and test reset functionality with proper confirmation dialogs. Conduct comprehensive accessibility testing using screen readers to ensure all audio controls are properly labeled and navigable. Performance test with rapid slider adjustments and multiple simultaneous audio previews to ensure smooth 60fps interactions.
