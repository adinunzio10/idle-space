# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Galaxy Map Rendering Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create interactive galaxy map with smooth zoom/pan navigation, beacon rendering, and connection visualization optimized for mobile performance.
# Details:
Use react-native-svg for scalable vector graphics with performance optimization. Implement GalaxyMapView component with react-native-gesture-handler for pinch/pan gestures. Create BeaconRenderer with LOD system - full detail at zoom >0.5x, simplified icons at <0.5x, cluster rendering beyond 500 beacons. Use transform3d for 60fps animations. Implement ConnectionRenderer for beacon links using cubic bezier curves. Add star field background with parallax scrolling using react-native-reanimated 3.0+. Include spatial indexing for efficient collision detection.

# Test Strategy:
Performance testing with 500+ beacons maintaining 60fps. Gesture responsiveness tests on various device sizes. Memory usage monitoring during extended pan/zoom sessions. Visual regression testing for rendering accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup SVG Canvas and Viewport Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize react-native-svg foundation with viewport management and coordinate system for the galaxy map.
### Details:
