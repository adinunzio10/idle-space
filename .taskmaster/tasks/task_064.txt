# Task ID: 64
# Title: Create Probe Capacity Upgrade UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 34, 41, 36
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement frontend components for the probe launch capacity system including capacity indicators, queue visualization, upgrade controls, and animated transitions with React Native and NativeWind styling.
# Details:
Create comprehensive ProbeCapacityUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **ProbeCapacityIndicator Component**: Implement capacity display using View components with NativeWind styling, featuring visual slot representation with occupied/available states, animated progress bar showing current usage (e.g., "5/8 Probes Active"), and color-coded visual indicators (active slots in quantum blue, queued in amber yellow, available in neutral gray). Include probe type icons and status badges for each occupied slot. 2) **ProbeQueueVisualization Component**: Create queue management interface displaying probe launch queue with TouchableOpacity cards for each queued probe, showing probe type, target coordinates, estimated launch time, and queue position. Implement drag-to-reorder functionality using react-native-gesture-handler for queue prioritization. 3) **CapacityUpgradeButton Component**: Design upgrade button with integrated resource validation, displaying current upgrade cost (Stellar Essence + Void Fragments), next capacity level preview, and disabled state when insufficient resources. Include haptic feedback and loading states during upgrade processing. 4) **SlotTransitionAnimator Component**: Implement smooth animations using react-native-reanimated for slot state changes, featuring slide-in effects for new probes, fade-out for completed missions, and pulsing animations for active probes. 5) **CapacityUpgradeModal Component**: Create preview modal using react-native-modal showing detailed upgrade information including current vs upgraded capacity, resource costs breakdown, estimated ROI calculations, and confirmation dialog with cancel/upgrade buttons. Include upgrade benefits visualization and permanent capacity increase effects. All components follow dark space theme with quantum-inspired gradients and consistent typography.

# Test Strategy:
Test ProbeCapacityIndicator rendering with various capacity states (empty, partial, full, over-capacity) and verify color-coding accuracy and slot animations. Validate ProbeQueueVisualization by populating queue with different probe types and testing drag-to-reorder functionality, ensuring queue position updates correctly. Test CapacityUpgradeButton resource validation by setting different resource amounts and confirming button enables/disables appropriately with accurate cost displays. Verify SlotTransitionAnimator performance by rapidly changing probe states and ensuring smooth animations without frame drops. Test CapacityUpgradeModal with various upgrade scenarios, confirming cost calculations, preview accuracy, and proper modal dismissal on successful upgrades.
