# Task ID: 44
# Title: Debug and Fix Modal Components Rendering Blank Content
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate and resolve issues causing modal components to display blank content despite receiving proper data, starting with the beacon upgrade modal accessed from galaxy map beacon selection.
# Details:
Systematically debug modal rendering issues across the application: 1) **Beacon Upgrade Modal Investigation**: Examine BeaconDetailsModal component (referenced in git status as modified) to identify why beacon data isn't displaying when passed from galaxy map selection. Check modal props passing, component state management, and data serialization between parent and modal components. 2) **Modal System Audit**: Review BaseModal component (also modified) for potential root cause issues affecting all modals - verify modal visibility states, content rendering logic, and proper mounting/unmounting cycles. 3) **Data Flow Analysis**: Trace data flow from beacon selection in GalaxyMapScreen through navigation/modal triggering to BeaconDetailsModal component. Check if beacon objects are properly serialized when passed between components, investigate React Native modal context issues, and verify no data is being lost in state transitions. 4) **Common Modal Patterns**: Identify if this is a systemic issue affecting other modals by checking MilestoneChoiceModal and any other modal components for similar blank content problems. Look for shared patterns in modal implementation that could cause widespread rendering failures. 5) **React Native Modal Specifics**: Investigate React Native modal-specific issues like portal rendering problems, z-index conflicts, or modal backdrop interfering with content display. Check for proper key props, modal animation states affecting content visibility, and ensure modal content isn't being rendered outside viewport bounds.

# Test Strategy:
Test modal functionality systematically: 1) Select various beacons on galaxy map and verify BeaconDetailsModal displays correct beacon information including level, specialization, connections, and upgrade options. 2) Test modal opening/closing animations don't interfere with content rendering. 3) Verify modal backdrop doesn't prevent content interaction. 4) Test on different device sizes to ensure modal content isn't rendered outside visible areas. 5) Check modal behavior during device rotation and app backgrounding/foregrounding. 6) Validate all other modal components (MilestoneChoiceModal, etc.) display their intended content correctly. 7) Test rapid modal open/close cycles to ensure no race conditions affect content display. 8) Use React Native debugging tools to inspect modal component hierarchy and verify props are properly passed to rendered content.
