# Task ID: 67
# Title: Create Stellar Reignition Visual Effects Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 42, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement frontend components for spectacular cascade event animations including particle systems, star reignition sequences, energy pulse effects, and ambient lighting changes using React Native and react-native-svg.
# Details:
Create comprehensive StellarReignitionVFX component suite with the following elements: 1) **ParticleSystemManager Component**: Implement energy wave particle system using react-native-reanimated with configurable particle count, velocity vectors, and lifespan management. Create particle emitters for energy waves radiating from reignited stars using Animated.Value arrays for position updates and opacity fading. Include particle recycling system for performance optimization. 2) **StarReignitionSequence Component**: Create dying star revival animation using react-native-svg Circle components with animated radius and fill color transitions. Implement 3-second animation sequence: phase 1 (0-1s): star pulses with expanding radius, phase 2 (1-2s): color transition from red/orange (#FF6B35, #FF8E53) to bright white/blue (#FFFFFF, #4FC3F7), phase 3 (2-3s): stabilization with gentle glow effect. Use Animated.timing with custom easing curves for smooth transitions. 3) **EnergyPulseEffect Component**: Design radial energy pulse animations using react-native-svg with expanding circles and gradient fills. Implement pulse propagation from reignited stars to nearby dead stars using distance calculations and staggered animation delays. Create cascading pulse chains with varying intensities based on distance and beacon connectivity. 4) **ScreenShakeEffect Component**: Implement device shake effects during major cascade events using react-native-reanimated transform animations. Create intensity-based shake patterns with configurable duration and frequency, triggered by CascadeEventManager. Include haptic feedback integration using expo-haptics for enhanced tactile experience. 5) **AmbientLightingOverlay Component**: Design blue/white glow overlays for revived sectors using react-native-svg with radialGradient definitions. Implement smooth lighting transitions with opacity animations and color blending for sector boundaries. Create dynamic lighting zones that expand as more stars are revived within sectors. 6) **CascadeHistoryVisualization Component**: Build interactive timeline component showing cascade event history using ScrollView with animated timeline markers. Display event details including trigger timestamp, affected sectors count, cascade chain length, and resource bonuses gained. Include visual indicators for cascade types (single vs. chain reactions) with appropriate animations and color coding following dark space theme.

# Test Strategy:
Test ParticleSystemManager performance by spawning 100+ particles simultaneously and verifying smooth 60fps animation performance on mid-range devices while monitoring memory usage for particle recycling efficiency. Validate StarReignitionSequence animation timing by measuring exact duration of each phase transition and confirming color values match specification at key animation points. Test EnergyPulseEffect cascade propagation by creating multiple dead stars at varying distances and verifying pulse timing delays correspond correctly to spatial relationships. Validate ScreenShakeEffect intensity scaling by triggering cascades of different magnitudes and confirming shake patterns match expected intensity curves. Test AmbientLightingOverlay rendering performance with multiple revived sectors and verify smooth blending between overlapping glow zones without visual artifacts. Validate CascadeHistoryVisualization with extensive cascade history data (50+ events) ensuring smooth scrolling performance and accurate timeline rendering.
