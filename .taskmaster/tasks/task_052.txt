# Task ID: 52
# Title: Comprehensive Performance Analysis and Optimization of Modular Galaxy Map System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 50, 3, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct systematic performance analysis of the modular galaxy map system to identify and resolve infinite render loops, React state management issues, and optimization bottlenecks affecting user experience.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive performance analysis and optimization strategy for the modular galaxy map system: 1) **Performance Profiling Setup**: Install and configure React DevTools Profiler, React Native Flipper performance plugins, and expo-gl-cpp for real-time FPS monitoring. Set up performance benchmarking suite using React Native Performance Monitor to establish baseline metrics across different device tiers. 2) **Render Loop Analysis**: Use React DevTools Profiler to identify components causing infinite re-renders, focusing on useEffect dependency arrays, useMemo/useCallback optimization opportunities, and unnecessary parent component updates. Implement render tracking middleware to log component update frequencies and identify hotspots. 3) **State Management Audit**: Review all React Context providers and useState/useReducer implementations for performance anti-patterns including: excessive context value object creation, missing memoization of context values, improper state normalization causing cascading updates, and state updates triggering unnecessary child re-renders. 4) **Memory Leak Detection**: Use React Native debugger memory tab and Chrome DevTools heap snapshots to identify memory leaks in the galaxy map system, particularly focusing on: event listeners not being cleaned up in useEffect cleanup functions, SVG DOM nodes accumulating without proper disposal, animation timers running indefinitely, and circular references in component state. 5) **Animation Performance**: Analyze React Native Reanimated worklet performance using the Reanimated DevTools, identifying JavaScript bridge crossings, UI thread blocking operations, and inefficient shared value updates. Optimize animation loops to maintain 60fps during pan/zoom operations with 500+ visible beacons. 6) **Component Architecture Review**: Evaluate the modular component system for performance bottlenecks including: excessive prop drilling causing unnecessary re-renders, missing React.memo implementations for pure components, inefficient reconciliation algorithms, and suboptimal component tree structure. Implement performance budgets: <16ms per frame, <100ms for user interactions, <50MB memory usage increase during map operations.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive performance testing protocol: 1) **Baseline Performance Measurement**: Establish performance baselines across device tiers (iPhone SE, mid-range Android, flagship devices) measuring FPS during pan/zoom, memory usage with 500+ beacons, and battery drain over 30-minute sessions. Document render times for each galaxy map component and identify performance regression thresholds. 2) **Render Loop Testing**: Use React DevTools Profiler to record component update frequencies during typical user interactions, identifying any components updating >10 times per second without user input. Test state updates using React's Concurrent Mode to ensure proper batching and priority scheduling. 3) **Memory Leak Validation**: Perform extended testing sessions (2+ hours) with repeated map interactions, monitoring memory usage patterns and garbage collection effectiveness. Use heap snapshots to verify proper cleanup of event listeners, animation timers, and DOM nodes after component unmounting. 4) **Animation Performance Verification**: Test smooth 60fps performance during simultaneous pan/zoom operations with maximum visible beacon count (500+). Verify worklet execution times stay <1ms using Reanimated profiler. Test gesture responsiveness with <50ms input lag across all device tiers. 5) **Stress Testing**: Execute performance stress tests including: rapid beacon placement/removal (10+ per second), continuous map panning for 5+ minutes, simultaneous probe launches with visual effects, and background state updates during foreground map interactions. Validate memory usage remains stable and FPS stays above 30fps minimum threshold.
