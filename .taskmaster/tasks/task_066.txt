# Title: Create Chronos Particles Shop Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement frontend components for the earned-only premium currency system including shop interface with categorized spending options, prominent earned-only labeling, particle cost displays, and purchase confirmation dialogs.
# Details:
Create comprehensive ChronosShopUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **ChronosShopInterface Component**: Implement main shop screen using ScrollView with NativeWind styling, featuring prominent 'EARNED ONLY' banner at top with quantum particle animation effects, categorized spending sections (Instant Completion, Network Boosts, Cosmetic Unlocks) using View containers with section headers and dividers. Include visual particle wallet indicator showing current balance with animated particle count updates. 2) **ChronosShopCategory Component**: Create category sections with TouchableOpacity items displaying purchase options, particle costs using Text components with quantum-themed styling, benefit descriptions, and availability states. Include cost comparison displays and savings indicators for bulk purchases. 3) **ChronosParticlePurchaseModal Component**: Implement confirmation dialog using react-native-modal with dark space theme, featuring purchase item preview, particle cost breakdown, current balance display, and 'EARNED ONLY' reminder text. Include confirm/cancel buttons with haptic feedback and insufficient balance state handling. 4) **ChronosSpendingHistory Component**: Create spending tracker displaying recent purchases with timestamps, particle amounts spent, items purchased, and remaining balance after each transaction. Use FlatList for efficient rendering with pull-to-refresh functionality. 5) **ParticleWalletIndicator Component**: Implement wallet display with current particle count, animated counter updates on balance changes, and prominent 'EARNED' badge emphasizing the earned-only nature of the currency.

# Test Strategy:
Test ChronosShopInterface rendering with various particle balance states (zero, low, high) and verify earned-only messaging displays prominently throughout all screens. Validate purchase confirmation modal by attempting purchases with sufficient/insufficient balances and confirming proper error states and success flows. Test spending history accuracy by making multiple purchases and verifying transaction records display correct timestamps, amounts, and balance calculations. Verify particle wallet indicator updates correctly when balance changes through earnings or spending, including smooth animation transitions and proper formatting of large numbers.
