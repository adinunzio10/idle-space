# Task ID: 70
# Title: Create Intelligent Probe AI Settings UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 34, 69, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement frontend components for the AI probe placement system including AI mode toggles, status indicators, visual feedback systems, learning progress displays, manual star marking interface, placement history visualization, and performance monitoring displays.
# Details:
Create comprehensive AIProbeUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **AISettingsToggle Component**: Implement toggle switch using react-native-switch with three AI modes - Off (manual control), Adaptive Learning (AI assists placement), Full Automation (AI handles all placement). Include visual state indicators with haptic feedback using expo-haptics and smooth transitions using react-native-reanimated. Use NativeWind styling for dark space theme with distinct colors for each mode. 2) **AIStatusHUD Component**: Create overlay component showing current AI mode status with animated indicators, placement confidence meter using progress bar, and real-time AI decision display. Include pulsing animations for active AI states and clear manual/AI control visual distinctions. 3) **AIReasoningDisplay Component**: Implement expandable panel showing AI placement logic with reason categories (pattern optimization, resource efficiency, star proximity), confidence scores with color-coded indicators, and alternative placement suggestions. Use ScrollView with animated expansion/collapse. 4) **LearningProgressIndicator Component**: Create progress tracking display showing AI adaptation metrics, learning milestones achieved, and performance improvement graphs using react-native-chart-kit with custom styling. Include neural network visualization using react-native-svg. 5) **ManualStarMarking Component**: Implement star selection interface allowing users to mark preferred targets with touch gestures, visual markers using SVG overlays, priority level assignment, and bias strength sliders. Include confirmation dialogs for target changes. 6) **AIHistoryVisualization Component**: Create placement history timeline showing AI decisions over time, success/failure tracking with color coding, pattern formation efficiency metrics, and decision reversal options. Use FlatList with custom timeline rendering. 7) **PerformanceMonitoring Component**: Implement real-time dashboard showing AI vs manual performance comparison, resource generation efficiency metrics, pattern completion rates, and recommendation accuracy tracking with statistical displays.

# Test Strategy:
Test AISettingsToggle component rendering with all three AI modes and verify proper state transitions, haptic feedback triggers, and visual indicator changes. Validate AIStatusHUD overlay positioning and animation performance during mode switches and placement activities. Test AIReasoningDisplay expansion/collapse animations and verify reasoning text updates reflect actual AI decision logic with mock placement scenarios. Validate LearningProgressIndicator chart rendering with various progress data sets and confirm milestone achievement animations trigger correctly. Test ManualStarMarking interface with touch gesture recognition, marker placement accuracy, and priority slider responsiveness across different screen sizes. Validate AIHistoryVisualization timeline rendering with large datasets, scroll performance, and decision detail modal functionality. Test PerformanceMonitoring dashboard with real-time data updates and verify statistical calculation accuracy for AI vs manual comparison metrics.
