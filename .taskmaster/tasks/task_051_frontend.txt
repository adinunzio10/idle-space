# Task ID: 51
# Title: Enhanced Sector Visualization - Replace simple rectangular test sectors with sophisticated Voronoi cell boundaries, smooth entropy gradients, hexagonal grid overlays, and organic sector shapes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete the galaxy map overhaul by implementing full logic, polish, and sophisticated rendering features for the modular galaxy map system created in task 50. Transform the basic modular foundation into a production-ready visualization engine with Voronoi boundaries, entropy gradients, hexagonal overlays, and organic sector shapes.
# Details:
Build upon the modular galaxy map foundation from task 50 to create a fully functional and polished galaxy visualization system: 1) **Complete Modular Component Logic**: Implement full business logic for all modular components created in task 50 (GalaxyMapCore, GalaxyMapModular, GalaxyOverlaySystem, SectorStateRenderer, OverlayControls). Connect data flow between components, implement proper state management, and add missing event handlers. 2) **Voronoi Sector Implementation**: Complete VoronoiSectorRenderer with full Fortune's algorithm implementation for organic cell boundaries. Integrate with existing SectorManager and ensure proper star system positioning within Voronoi cells. Add boundary caching and regeneration logic based on sector changes. 3) **Enhanced Visual Polish**: Implement smooth entropy gradient transitions using SVG radialGradient elements with proper color interpolation (healthy blue #3B82F6 → dying orange #F59E0B → dead red #EF4444). Add sophisticated boundary rendering with bezier curves, glow effects, and zoom-adaptive detail levels. 4) **Hexagonal Grid Overlay**: Complete HexagonalGridOverlay with adaptive density based on zoom level and proper opacity transitions. Ensure grid alignment with sector boundaries and implement performance-optimized rendering. 5) **Production-Ready Features**: Add comprehensive error handling, loading states, and fallback rendering for all modular components. Implement proper cleanup and memory management. Add debug overlays and development tools integration. 6) **Integration & Testing**: Ensure all modular components work seamlessly together, integrate with existing BeaconRenderer and StarSystem components, and validate the complete galaxy map experience meets performance requirements (60fps with 500+ beacons).

# Test Strategy:
Validate complete modular system integration by testing data flow between all components created in task 50. Test Voronoi cell generation accuracy with various star system distributions and verify no boundary overlaps or gaps exist. Validate smooth entropy gradient rendering with proper color transitions and performance optimization. Test hexagonal grid overlay visibility, opacity transitions, and alignment across multiple zoom levels. Verify organic sector shapes render correctly with noise-based boundary perturbation. Conduct comprehensive performance testing with 100+ sectors and 500+ beacons ensuring 60fps maintenance on target mobile devices. Test error handling, loading states, and graceful degradation scenarios.
