# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create User Interface and HUD System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop mobile-optimized UI with resource displays, floating action buttons, and strategic navigation architecture using NativeWind styling.
# Details:
Install NativeWind 2.0+ with Tailwind CSS configuration optimized for React Native. Create responsive HUD with fixed resource counters at top using safe-area-context. Implement floating action button at bottom for probe launches with haptic feedback. Design strategic navigation architecture: use full-screen React Native screens with proper navigation for main destinations (Settings, Statistics, Pattern Gallery), while reserving react-native-modal only for contextual actions over the galaxy map (beacon upgrades, probe details, quick info panels, temporary overlays). Galaxy map remains central persistent view with contextual modals. Add scientific notation formatting for large numbers using numeral.js. Create theme system with dark space aesthetic: deep purple/black backgrounds, cyan/white accents. Implement one-handed navigation with all controls within thumb reach. Add accessibility support with proper labeling and font scaling.

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive design across device sizes. Verify one-handed usability on various screen sizes. Test navigation flow between full screens and modal overlays. Verify modal performance over galaxy map. Accessibility testing with screen readers. Performance testing of modal animations and screen transitions.
