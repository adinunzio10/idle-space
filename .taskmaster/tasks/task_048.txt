# Task ID: 48
# Title: Debug Galaxy Star Map Entropy Rendering Artifacts
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 38, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate and resolve visual artifacting issues in the galaxy star map where entropy mechanics create large uneven squares that change color, likely caused by sector rendering or entropy visualization problems.
# Details:
Debug the galaxy star map entropy rendering system to eliminate visual artifacts: 1) **Artifact Investigation**: Examine SectorOverlayManager and entropy visualization components for rendering inconsistencies. Common causes include: improper SVG path generation for sector boundaries, incorrect opacity calculations during entropy transitions, z-index conflicts between entropy overlays and star systems, texture bleeding from sector state transitions. 2) **Sector Rendering Issues**: Review hexagonal sector grid generation in GalaxySectorManager, verify sector boundary calculations don't create overlapping regions, check for floating-point precision errors in coordinate transformations, validate sector state color interpolation functions. 3) **Entropy Visualization Fixes**: Debug EntropySystem's visual effects including particle systems, color gradients, and state transitions. Fix entropy spread animation timing to prevent abrupt color changes, implement proper alpha blending for overlapping entropy effects, optimize entropy particle rendering to avoid clustering artifacts. 4) **SVG Optimization**: Review react-native-svg usage for sector overlays, implement proper viewBox calculations, fix path data generation for consistent sector shapes, add proper clipping masks to prevent overflow artifacts. 5) **Performance Optimization**: Implement sector culling for off-screen regions, add entropy effect batching to reduce draw calls, optimize color transition calculations using GPU-friendly interpolation methods.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing of galaxy map visual integrity: 1) **Artifact Detection**: Load galaxy map with various entropy states and zoom levels, systematically scan for square artifacts or color bleeding, test entropy transitions over time to identify visual discontinuities. 2) **Sector Boundary Verification**: Zoom to different levels and verify hexagonal sector boundaries render consistently without gaps or overlaps, test sector state transitions (healthy->dying->dead) for smooth color changes. 3) **Entropy Animation Testing**: Observe entropy spread mechanics in real-time, verify particle effects flow smoothly between sectors without clustering, test entropy visualization with multiple simultaneous spreading events. 4) **Cross-Platform Validation**: Test on iOS, Android, and web platforms to identify platform-specific rendering differences, verify SVG rendering consistency across React Native implementations. 5) **Performance Impact**: Monitor frame rate during heavy entropy activity, test memory usage with extended entropy animations, verify rendering performance doesn't degrade with multiple active entropy sources.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Investigate Rendering System Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the GalaxyMapView rendering pipeline, SVG component usage, and identify visual artifacts in star map rendering. Examine react-native-svg usage patterns, transform calculations, and viewport state management for potential square artifact sources.
### Details:
Examine the GalaxyMapView.tsx component (lines 159-2046) which uses react-native-svg for galaxy rendering. Focus on: SVG viewBox calculations and transformations, AnimatedSvg and AnimatedG component usage, viewport bounds calculations in calculateVisibleBounds(), transform prop generation in useAnimatedProps().

INVESTIGATION COMPLETE: Root cause identified as fundamental architectural mismatch between grid-based sector system and expected Voronoi-based entropy visualization. Key findings: EntropyVisualization component implements simplified rectangular grid cells with random perturbation rather than organic Voronoi regions, causing square boundary artifacts. SectorManager's generateCells() method creates uniform grid with slight randomization instead of proper Voronoi tessellation. Grid-based neighbor calculations produce artificial straight-line boundaries that appear as uneven squares when entropy transitions occur. Entropy rendering uses overlapping SVG radial gradients that compound visual artifacts at sector boundaries. Hexagonal grid overlay system conflicts with underlying rectangular sector structure, creating visual inconsistencies. Primary fix required: Replace grid-based sector generation with proper Voronoi tessellation algorithm to create organic sector boundaries that eliminate square artifacts.

## 2. Debug Sector Grid System Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 48.1
### Description: Implement and debug the missing GalaxySectorManager and SectorOverlayManager components responsible for hexagonal sector grid generation and entropy visualization overlays.
### Details:
Since the search reveals no existing SectorOverlayManager or GalaxySectorManager components, these need to be implemented based on task 26 requirements. Create GalaxySectorManager class for hexagonal sector grid using axial coordinate system. Implement SectorOverlayManager for entropy visualization overlays. Focus on: proper hexagonal grid generation algorithms, sector boundary calculations to prevent overlapping regions, floating-point precision in coordinate transformations, sector state color interpolation functions. Ensure SVG path generation for sector boundaries is mathematically correct.

Fixed the sector grid system completely by replacing the original hexagonal grid approach with proper Voronoi tessellation. Key implementation changes made:

1. **Voronoi Tessellation Implementation**: Created generateVoronoiVertices() function using radial sampling around each sector center with perpendicular bisector calculations to generate organic cell boundaries instead of rigid hexagonal shapes.

2. **Improved Neighbor Detection**: Replaced grid-based neighbor finding with distance thresholding algorithm that calculates actual spatial relationships between Voronoi cells rather than assuming grid positions.

3. **Lloyd's Relaxation Algorithm**: Implemented iterative relaxation with damping factor to improve cell quality by moving sector centers toward their Voronoi cell centroids, creating more uniform and natural-looking boundaries.

4. **Polygon Simplification**: Added vertex reduction algorithm to remove redundant points from Voronoi polygons, reducing SVG path complexity while maintaining visual fidelity.

5. **Compilation Fixes**: Added missing seeds property to SectorManager class to resolve TypeScript compilation errors that were preventing the grid system from functioning.

The new Voronoi-based system successfully eliminates the rectangular artifacts that were causing the large uneven squares in the entropy visualization. The organic cell boundaries provide smooth entropy transitions without the harsh geometric edges that were creating visual discontinuities.
