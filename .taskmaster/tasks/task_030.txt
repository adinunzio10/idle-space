# Task ID: 30
# Title: Integrate Analytics SDK for Player Behavior Tracking and Balance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27, 29
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive backend analytics tracking system using industry-standard SDK to monitor player behavior metrics including retention rates, progression milestones, resource generation patterns, and session data for game balance optimization with privacy-compliant data handling.
# Details:
Integrate analytics SDK (Firebase Analytics or similar) with privacy-first backend event tracking system: 1) **Core Metrics Implementation**: Track 7-day and 30-day retention using cohort analysis with anonymous user IDs. Monitor progression milestones including beacon placement counts, first pattern completion, prestige events, and achievement unlocks. Record resource generation rates per session and cumulative totals across Quantum Data, Stellar Essence, and Void Fragments. Track pattern completion rates by geometric type (triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons) and complexity levels. 2) **Session Analytics Backend**: Implement session length tracking with background/foreground state management using AppState APIs. Record beacon placement frequency, probe launch patterns, and upgrade decisions. Track user interactions and feature usage patterns through backend data processing. 3) **Balance Optimization Data Processing**: Monitor resource economy health through spending patterns, accumulation rates, and bottleneck identification. Track beacon type distribution and specialization choices to identify meta preferences. Record offline progression engagement and return session behaviors. Process analytics data for balance insights and optimization recommendations. 4) **Privacy-Compliant Data Handling**: Implement GDPR/CCPA compliant data processing with anonymous identifiers and data minimization principles. Use hashed device identifiers without personally identifiable information. Ensure backend systems support data export/deletion requests through automated processes. 5) **AnalyticsManager Backend Implementation**: Create AnalyticsManager class with event queuing, batch uploading, and offline capability. Implement robust data validation and sanitization before transmission. Set up backend data processing pipeline for real-time balance monitoring and A/B testing framework preparation. Handle consent state management and data collection control through backend flags.

# Test Strategy:
Verify analytics SDK initialization and backend event processing accuracy. Test event tracking for all core metrics with simulated gameplay scenarios including beacon placement, pattern formation, resource accumulation, and prestige resets. Validate session tracking with background/foreground transitions and app termination scenarios through backend monitoring. Test privacy-compliant data handling ensuring backend systems respect opt-out states and can process data export/deletion requests. Verify offline event queuing and batch upload functionality when connectivity returns. Test analytics data accuracy by comparing backend-tracked metrics with actual game state across multiple play sessions. Validate retention calculation accuracy with controlled backend data processing and time-based cohort analysis.
