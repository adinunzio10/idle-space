# Task ID: 60
# Title: Create Achievement System UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29, 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement comprehensive frontend components for the achievement system including progress tracking, notifications, collection screens, and celebration animations with React Native and NativeWind styling.
# Details:
Create AchievementUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **AchievementProgressCard Component**: Implement individual achievement cards using View components with NativeWind styling, featuring achievement icon, title, description, progress bar using react-native-progress with custom styling, completion percentage display, and reward preview (Chronos Particles amount). Include locked/unlocked states with opacity transitions and completion checkmark animations. 2) **AchievementNotificationSystem**: Integrate react-native-toast-message for achievement completion notifications with custom toast templates matching dark space theme, slide-in animations, haptic feedback on completion, and auto-dismiss after 4 seconds. Configure toast positioning for mobile-safe areas and implement queue system for multiple simultaneous achievements. 3) **AchievementCollectionScreen**: Create full-screen component with categorized tabs (Beacon Milestones, Pattern Discovery, Resource Generation, Special Events) using react-native-tab-view or custom tab implementation. Implement FlatList with sections for performance, search/filter functionality, and completion percentage tracker at top. Include category-specific icons and progress summaries. 4) **CompletionCelebrationAnimation**: Implement celebration effects using react-native-reanimated with particle burst animations, screen flash effects, and confetti particles using react-native-confetti-cannon. Create staggered animation sequences with scale transforms, rotation effects, and color transitions. 5) **Mobile Accessibility**: Implement proper accessibility labels, screen reader support, semantic roles, focus management, and respect for system text size preferences. Ensure minimum touch targets of 44px and proper color contrast ratios for all text elements.

# Test Strategy:
Test AchievementProgressCard rendering with various achievement states (locked, in-progress, completed) and verify progress bar animations and percentage calculations display correctly. Validate notification system by triggering multiple achievements simultaneously and confirming proper toast queuing, positioning, and auto-dismiss behavior. Test AchievementCollectionScreen performance with large datasets of achievements across all categories, ensuring smooth scrolling and tab switching. Verify celebration animations trigger correctly on achievement completion with proper timing and visual effects. Test accessibility features using screen readers, voice control, and various text size settings to ensure full compliance with mobile accessibility standards.
