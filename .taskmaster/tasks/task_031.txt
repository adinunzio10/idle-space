# Task ID: 31
# Title: Create Audio System with Ambient Music and Sound Effects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive backend audio system featuring ambient space music management, sound effect processing, audio ducking algorithms, and persistent audio settings without any UI components.
# Details:
Install expo-av for audio playback capabilities and react-native-track-player for background music management. Create AudioManager class with backend methods: playAmbientTrack(), playBeaconPlacement(), playPatternComplete(), playProbeLaunch(), playReignitionEvent(), and stopAllSounds(). Implement ambient music system with 3-5 looping space-themed tracks (cosmic drones, stellar winds, quantum harmonics) using seamless loop points and track transition algorithms. Create sound effect library with backend processing: beacon placement (harmonic chime with pitch variation based on beacon level), pattern completion (ascending musical phrase with intensity based on pattern size), probe launch (swoosh with type-specific pitch - Pioneer high, Harvester mid, Architect low), stellar reignition (triumphant orchestral swell with particle effects sync). Implement AudioSettings class for volume control persistence and audio configuration management (master volume, music volume, effects volume, mute states) stored in save system. Create fade transition algorithms between ambient tracks based on galaxy sector entropy levels using mathematical interpolation. Implement audio ducking algorithms to reduce music volume during important sound effects with automatic restoration. Create AudioPreloader class to cache frequently used sounds for instant playback with memory management. Add haptic feedback synchronization algorithms with major audio events using expo-haptics timing coordination.

# Test Strategy:
Test audio engine functionality across iOS and Android platforms with various device audio configurations. Verify ambient music loops seamlessly without gaps using automated audio analysis. Test sound effect timing accuracy with simulated game events through unit testing of AudioManager methods. Verify volume control algorithms affect appropriate audio channels independently through isolated testing. Test audio state persistence across app backgrounding and save/load cycles. Performance testing to ensure audio processing doesn't impact frame rate during intensive gameplay. Test audio ducking algorithms during overlapping music and effects with automated volume level monitoring. Verify haptic feedback synchronization timing with audio cues through millisecond-accurate testing.
