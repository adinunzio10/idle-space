# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Beacon Count Milestone System with Binary Upgrade Choices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a backend progression system that tracks beacon count milestones and manages binary upgrade choices at specific thresholds (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500), with permanent decision storage that shapes player strategy through efficiency/speed, generation/offline earnings, and range/stability progression paths.
# Details:
Implement backend MilestoneManager class for beacon count progression and upgrade choice management: 1) **Milestone Tracking Backend**: Create beacon count listener that monitors total placed beacons across all types, triggering milestone events at 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 beacons. Implement milestone calculation algorithms and threshold detection logic. Store completed milestones in player progression data via SaveManager integration. 2) **Binary Choice System Logic**: Design backend binary choice system with two mutually exclusive upgrade paths at each milestone - Efficiency vs Speed (affects resource generation rate vs probe deployment time), Generation vs Offline Earnings (boosts active play vs away progress multipliers), Range vs Stability (increases beacon connection radius vs pattern bonus strength). Implement choice validation and permanent decision storage mechanisms. 3) **Milestone Bonus Application**: Store player milestone decisions in persistent data structure, applying chosen bonuses permanently to relevant game systems. Create bonus application logic for Efficiency choices modifying ResourceManager generation rates, Speed choices affecting ProbeManager deployment timers, Generation choices boosting active multipliers, Offline choices increasing away progress caps, Range choices extending beacon connection radii, Stability choices amplifying pattern detection bonuses. 4) **Save System Integration**: Integrate milestone progression data with existing SaveManager for persistent storage across sessions. Implement milestone data serialization and deserialization for game state management.

# Test Strategy:
Test milestone trigger accuracy by programmatically placing exactly 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 beacons and verifying milestone events fire with correct choice data structures. Verify each choice permanently applies intended bonuses to appropriate game systems through backend calculations (resource generation rates, probe timers, connection ranges, pattern multipliers). Test milestone progression persistence across game sessions through SaveManager integration. Validate milestone bonus calculations and choice storage accuracy.
