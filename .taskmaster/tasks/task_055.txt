# Task ID: 55
# Title: Fix React Native Reanimated Object Mutation Warnings in Beacon Rendering System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 11, 53
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify and resolve 240 React Native Reanimated warnings caused by modifying object keys that have been passed to worklets, focusing on beacon rendering components that are mutating id, x, y, size, color, glowSize, glowOpacity, level, type, and active properties.
# Details:
Based on the analysis report showing 240 warnings across 10 unique keys, implement comprehensive fixes for Reanimated object mutation issues: 1) **Object Cloning Strategy**: Create deep clone utility functions for beacon data before passing to Reanimated worklets. Focus on BeaconRenderer, BeaconRenderingModule, VisualDecayEffects, EntropyVisualization, AccessibilityManager, and AudioManager components that are mutating beacon properties (id, x, y, size, color, glowSize, glowOpacity, level, type, active). 2) **Worklet Data Flow Audit**: Review all worklet functions in beacon rendering system to ensure they receive immutable copies of data rather than references to mutable objects. Implement Object.freeze() on data passed to worklets where mutation is not intended. 3) **BeaconRenderingModule Priority Fix**: Address the most problematic module (BeaconRenderingModule) which appears in multiple warning contexts. Refactor beacon data preparation to create isolated copies for worklet consumption. 4) **Systematic Property Isolation**: Implement structured approach to isolate each problematic property: create BeaconWorkletData interface with immutable properties, use spread operator or structured cloning for beacon objects before worklet calls, ensure position (x, y), visual (size, color, glow*), and metadata (id, level, type, active) properties are properly isolated. 5) **Performance Optimization**: Implement object pooling for frequently cloned beacon data to prevent garbage collection issues from excessive object creation during rendering.

# Test Strategy:
Validate elimination of all 240 Reanimated object mutation warnings through systematic testing: 1) **Warning Count Verification**: Run the application with Reanimated warnings enabled and confirm zero 'tried to modify key of an object which has been already passed to a worklet' warnings appear in logs. Test with various beacon counts (10, 100, 500+) to ensure fixes scale properly. 2) **Component-Specific Testing**: Test each identified problematic component (BeaconRenderer, BeaconRenderingModule, VisualDecayEffects, EntropyVisualization, AccessibilityManager, AudioManager) individually to verify no mutations occur during worklet operations. 3) **Property Mutation Testing**: For each of the 10 problematic keys (id, x, y, size, color, glowSize, glowOpacity, level, type, active), create targeted tests that attempt to modify these properties in worklet contexts and verify no warnings are generated. 4) **Performance Impact Assessment**: Measure rendering performance before and after fixes to ensure object cloning doesn't negatively impact 60fps target. Test memory usage during extended sessions to verify object pooling effectiveness. 5) **Regression Testing**: Test all beacon rendering functionality (placement, animation, visual effects, level changes) to ensure cloning strategy doesn't break existing behavior. Verify beacon interactions, pattern detection, and visual feedback systems continue working correctly with immutable data approach.

Investigation findings confirm 240 object mutation warnings in beacon rendering worklets. Identified primary source as BeaconRenderer useAnimatedProps directly accessing renderData properties without cloning. Warnings span 10 beacon properties: id, x, y, size, color, glowSize, glowOpacity, level, type, active. Root cause is worklet boundary violations where JavaScript objects passed to worklets are subsequently modified by React state updates. Investigation phase complete, proceeding to implement cloning utilities as planned.

## 2. Fix BeaconRenderer Component Worklet Mutations [done]
### Dependencies: 55.1
### Description: Resolve 24+ Reanimated warnings in BeaconRenderer by implementing proper data cloning before worklet calls
### Details:
Audit BeaconRenderer component to identify all worklet functions receiving mutable beacon objects. Replace direct beacon object passing with cloned immutable copies using the deepCloneBeaconData utility. Focus on render worklets, animation callbacks, and gesture handlers that are mutating beacon properties. Ensure position updates (x, y), visual changes (size, color, glow properties), and state changes (active, level) use isolated copies.

Located specific worklet mutation issue in useAnimatedProps at BeaconRenderer:179-191 where renderData object properties are directly accessed within worklet context. Root cause identified: renderData contains mutable beacon objects being passed directly to Reanimated worklets without proper cloning. Solution will implement cloned worklet-safe data structure before useAnimatedProps to eliminate mutation warnings while preserving animation performance.

## 3. Refactor BeaconRenderingModule Worklet Data Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 55.1
### Description: Fix complex BeaconRenderingModule system to prevent worklet object mutations across module boundaries
### Details:
Analyze BeaconRenderingModule's module system architecture to identify worklet boundary violations. Refactor beacon data preparation pipeline to create isolated copies for each module's worklet consumption. Implement module-specific data transformation that preserves object immutability. Update inter-module communication to pass cloned beacon data rather than shared references. Ensure spatial indexing and performance optimization systems work with immutable data patterns.
<info added on 2025-09-04T22:14:38.165Z>
Currently implementing beacon data cloning in BeaconRenderingModule.renderElements() method. The renderElements method creates React components that receive beacon objects as props, which then get passed to BeaconRenderer components containing worklets. To prevent mutations, implementing structured cloning of beacon objects before they're passed as props to rendering components. This ensures each rendered beacon component receives its own immutable copy of beacon data, preventing worklet boundary violations when BeaconRenderer accesses beacon properties like id, x, y, size, color, glowSize, glowOpacity, level, type, and active within its animation worklets.

## 7. Enhanced Testing Suite for React Native Reanimated Object Mutation Detection [done]
### Dependencies: 55.1, 55.2, 55.3, 55.4, 55.5, 55.6
### Description: Create automated testing infrastructure to identify and prevent React Native Reanimated object mutation warnings, specifically targeting the '[Reanimated] Tried to modify key {key} of an object which has been already passed to a worklet' error pattern.
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive testing framework to detect and prevent Reanimated object mutation issues: 1) **Automated Warning Detection System**: Create custom Jest matchers and test utilities that capture React Native Reanimated console warnings during test execution. Implement warning parsers that extract mutation details (key names, object types, component sources) from Reanimated error messages. Set up test environment configuration to enable Reanimated warnings in test mode while suppressing other debug output. 2) **Worklet Object Tracking Tests**: Build test utilities that monitor object references passed to worklets, creating snapshots of object states before and after worklet execution. Implement property change detection that identifies when worklet-bound objects are modified outside the worklet context. Create mock worklet environments for testing object immutability patterns. 3) **Component-Specific Mutation Tests**: Design targeted test cases for beacon rendering components (BeaconRenderer, VisualDecayEffects, EntropyVisualization) that validate proper object cloning before worklet usage. Test gesture handler implementations to ensure shared values and animated objects maintain immutability. Create regression tests that simulate the exact mutation patterns identified in the 240 warning instances. 4) **Continuous Monitoring Infrastructure**: Implement test reporters that track warning counts and categorize mutation types across test runs. Set up CI/CD integration that fails builds when new Reanimated object mutations are introduced. Create performance benchmarks to ensure object cloning strategies don't impact animation performance. 5) **Development Tooling**: Build development-time warning aggregators that collect and analyze Reanimated warnings during local development. Create ESLint rules that detect common patterns leading to worklet object mutations. Implement runtime assertion utilities for validating object immutability in development builds.
