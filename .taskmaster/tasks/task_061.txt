# Task ID: 61
# Title: Create Analytics Consent Management UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement GDPR/CCPA compliant privacy controls including consent dialogs, privacy settings, data transparency displays, and export/deletion interfaces with React Native components.
# Details:
Create comprehensive privacy compliance UI components: 1) **InitialConsentDialog Component**: Implement modal using react-native-modal with dark space theme, featuring clear data usage explanation, accept/decline buttons with haptic feedback, and 'Learn More' expandable section detailing specific data collection practices. Include ConsentExplanation component showing data types collected (gameplay analytics, device info, crash reports) and their purposes. 2) **PrivacySettingsScreen**: Create full-screen component with granular toggle controls using Switch components for each data category (analytics, personalization, marketing, crash reporting). Implement PrivacyToggleGroup with section headers and descriptions. Include 'Reset All' and 'Save Preferences' buttons with confirmation dialogs. 3) **DataTransparencyDisplay**: Create scrollable view showing collected data categories, retention periods, and third-party sharing status. Implement CollectedDataCard components displaying data type, collection frequency, and user control options. 4) **ExportDeleteInterface**: Implement data request forms with email input validation, request type selection (export/delete), and status tracking. Create RequestStatusTracker showing submission confirmation and processing timeline. 5) **ConsentStatusIndicator**: Create persistent UI element showing current consent status with quick access to privacy settings. Implement animated status icons and last-updated timestamps. Use AsyncStorage for preference persistence and create ConsentManager class for centralized consent state management with automatic compliance checking.

# Test Strategy:
Test InitialConsentDialog presentation on first app launch and verify consent choices persist correctly across app restarts. Validate privacy settings toggles by changing preferences and confirming AsyncStorage updates reflect changes accurately. Test data transparency display with various data collection scenarios ensuring all collected information types are properly documented and displayed. Verify export/deletion request forms handle email validation, submission confirmation, and error states appropriately. Test consent status indicators update correctly when privacy preferences change and provide proper navigation to settings screens. Validate compliance with platform privacy requirements by testing consent flows on both iOS and Android, ensuring proper integration with system privacy settings and app transparency reports.
