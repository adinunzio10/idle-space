# Task ID: 71
# Title: Create Offline Progression Summary UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 34, 41, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement frontend components for the enhanced offline progression system including animated counters, beacon placement visualization, network statistics, and engaging progression feedback animations.
# Details:
Create comprehensive OfflineProgressionUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **OfflineProgressModal Component**: Implement modal dialog using react-native-modal with dark space theme styling, featuring animated counters showing probe completions by type (Pioneer, Harvester, Architect) using react-native-reanimated with count-up animations from 0 to final values over 2-3 seconds. Include probe type icons with completion badges and haptic feedback on modal appearance. 2) **BeaconPlacementVisualization Component**: Create beacon placement summary using ScrollView with coordinate displays showing new beacon positions in a grid format, including beacon type indicators and connection previews. Use NativeWind styling with quantum-themed borders and glow effects for newly placed beacons. 3) **NetworkConnectionCounter Component**: Implement animated counter for new network connections formed, featuring connection line animations using react-native-svg with path drawing effects and connection strength indicators. 4) **PatternCompletionCelebration Component**: Create celebration effects for completed patterns using particle systems with react-native-reanimated, including pattern type badges (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon) with completion glow animations and bonus multiplier displays. 5) **ResourceGenerationSummary Component**: Design comprehensive resource breakdown showing Quantum Data, Stellar Essence, and Void Fragments generated during offline period, with pattern bonus breakdowns displayed as expandable sections using collapsible views. Include animated progress bars showing contribution percentages. 6) **NetworkExpansionStats Component**: Create statistics display showing network growth metrics including total beacon count, average connection strength, network coverage area expansion, and efficiency improvements with visual charts using react-native-svg for data visualization. All components use consistent dark space theme with smooth animated transitions and proper accessibility labels.

# Test Strategy:
Test OfflineProgressModal rendering with various offline durations and progression amounts, verifying animated counters start from zero and count up to correct final values with proper timing. Validate BeaconPlacementVisualization by testing with different quantities of newly placed beacons, confirming coordinate accuracy and proper scrolling behavior for large numbers of placements. Test NetworkConnectionCounter animations by simulating various connection formation scenarios and verifying SVG path animations render smoothly at 60fps. Validate PatternCompletionCelebration effects by triggering celebrations for each pattern type (triangle through hexagon) and confirming particle animations, glow effects, and bonus displays function correctly. Test ResourceGenerationSummary with edge cases including zero generation, massive offline sessions, and pattern bonus calculations to ensure breakdown accuracy and expandable sections work properly. Validate NetworkExpansionStats chart rendering with various network sizes and verify SVG data visualization performance with large datasets while maintaining smooth animations.
