# Task ID: 28
# Title: Enhance Offline Progression System with Queued Probe Completions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement offline progression calculations for probes launched before going offline, automatically placing completed beacons and displaying a summary of network expansion that occurred during offline time.
# Details:
Enhance the existing offline progression system to handle queued probe operations: 1) **Offline Probe Tracking**: Extend ResourceManager's offline calculation system to track active probes when app becomes inactive. Store probe launch timestamps, types, and target coordinates in persistent storage using AsyncStorage. Implement ProbeQueueManager to serialize/deserialize probe queue state across app sessions. 2) **Completion Calculation**: On app return, calculate elapsed offline time and determine which probes completed based on launch time + deployment duration (Pioneer: 30s, Harvester: 90s, Architect: 60s). Account for any manual acceleration bonuses that were active when launched. 3) **Automated Beacon Placement**: For completed probes, automatically spawn beacons at their target coordinates using existing BeaconManager.createBeacon() method. Respect beacon placement rules and connection validation. Update network topology and trigger pattern detection for newly placed beacons. 4) **Offline Summary Display**: Create OfflineProgressModal component showing: number of probes completed by type, beacons placed with coordinates, new connections formed, patterns completed, resources generated from new network expansion. Use animated counters for engaging progression feedback. 5) **Resource Integration**: Calculate and award resources generated by newly placed beacons during offline time, including pattern bonuses from completed geometric shapes. Update total resource accumulation in existing offline progression summary.

# Test Strategy:
Test probe queue persistence across app restarts with various probe types and launch times. Verify offline time calculation accuracy for probe completion with different deployment durations and manual acceleration states. Test automatic beacon placement at correct coordinates with proper network connection validation. Validate pattern detection triggers for newly placed beacons forming geometric shapes. Test offline summary modal displays accurate probe completion counts and network expansion statistics. Verify resource calculations include bonuses from new patterns formed by offline beacon placements. Performance testing with large numbers of queued probes (50+) during extended offline periods.
