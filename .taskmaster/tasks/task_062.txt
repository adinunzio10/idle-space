# Task ID: 62
# Title: Create App Store Marketing Assets Frontend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 38, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and generate all visual assets for app store distribution including device-specific screenshots, app icons, splash screens, store listing elements, and promotional graphics with focus on visual design and frontend presentation materials.
# Details:
Create comprehensive marketing asset generation system with the following components: 1) **Screenshot Generation System**: Implement automated screenshot capture using expo-screenshot for iPhone 6.5/5.5 and iPad Pro dimensions, creating scripted gameplay sequences showcasing key features (galaxy map with beacons, resource generation, pattern formation, upgrade screens). Use device simulators with programmatic navigation to capture consistent, high-quality screenshots. 2) **App Icon Variants**: Design adaptive app icon system with multiple resolutions (20x20 to 1024x1024) and platform-specific variants (iOS rounded corners, Android adaptive icons), featuring the Signal Garden quantum beacon theme with dark space background and glowing elements. 3) **Splash Screen Assets**: Create platform-specific splash screens using expo-splash-screen with consistent branding, loading animations using react-native-reanimated for smooth transitions, and proper asset optimization for various screen densities. 4) **Store Listing Visuals**: Design promotional graphics including feature graphics for Google Play (1024x500), promotional banners showcasing idle gameplay mechanics, achievement celebrations, and galaxy expansion progression. 5) **Marketing Asset Templates**: Create reusable design templates using React Native components for generating promotional materials, social media assets, and press kit elements with consistent Signal Garden branding and typography. 6) **Asset Management System**: Implement AssetGeneratorManager to programmatically create, optimize, and export all marketing materials with proper file naming conventions and platform requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test screenshot generation system by running automated capture sequences across different device simulators and verifying image quality, proper UI element visibility, and consistent gameplay representation. Validate app icon variants by testing installation across iOS and Android devices, confirming proper rendering at all required resolutions and adherence to platform design guidelines. Test splash screen performance by measuring load times and animation smoothness across various device specifications. Verify store listing graphics meet platform requirements (file sizes, dimensions, content guidelines) by uploading test assets to app store consoles. Test marketing asset templates by generating multiple promotional materials and confirming consistent branding, typography, and visual hierarchy across all outputs.
