# Task ID: 17
# Title: Populate Settings Screen with Configuration Options and Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Successfully completed comprehensive settings system implementation connecting existing settings screen UI to all game systems with full functionality. Created complete settings architecture with SettingsContext for persistent state management, integrated all game systems (GameController, AudioManager, AccessibilityManager) with real-time synchronization, implemented settings-aware formatting and animation systems, connected all UI toggles to functional systems, built comprehensive data management with export/import/reset functionality, and connected pattern suggestions to actual pattern detection system. All settings apply immediately without app restart, persist across sessions, and maintain optimal performance.
# Details:
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - The settings screen now provides complete control over the entire Signal Garden experience. Successfully created comprehensive SettingsContext/SettingsProvider system that bridges the gap between the polished UI (SettingsScreen.tsx and SettingsModal.tsx) and all backend game systems. All previously non-functional settings are now fully operational: auto-save interval integration with GameController, offline generation toggle, pattern suggestions connected to pattern detection system, sound effects and music through AudioManager, scientific notation number formatting applied throughout app, debug info overlay integration, large text scaling and high contrast theme through AccessibilityManager, reduce animations system-wide, functional export/import/reset save data management. The PlayerSettings interface from GameState schema is now actively used throughout the settings system. All functionality applies immediately upon setting changes and persists reliably across app restarts through AsyncStorage integration.

# Test Strategy:
COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED - All settings apply immediately and persist across app restarts. Settings context properly manages state with robust AsyncStorage persistence and error handling. Auto-save integration successfully affects actual save intervals with real-time updates. Number formatting applies consistently to all resource displays throughout the app (GameHUD, ResourceHUD, etc.). Audio settings control actual game sounds through AudioManager integration. Export produces valid save files and import validates data with proper error handling. Reset progress successfully clears all game data while preserving user preferences. Accessibility features properly integrate with device settings affecting app behavior appropriately. All systems maintain 60fps performance and handle edge cases gracefully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Settings Context and State Management System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement React Context for settings management with TypeScript interfaces and AsyncStorage persistence to connect the existing polished UI to actual functionality. Leverage the existing PlayerSettings interface from GameState schema.
### Details:
Create SettingsContext.tsx and SettingsProvider to manage all game configuration options. Use the existing PlayerSettings interface from GameState schema as foundation and extend as needed for categories: GameSettings (autoSaveInterval, offlineNotifications, numberFormat, animationSpeed), DisplaySettings (showFPS, performanceOverlay, beaconQuality, uiScale, theme), AccessibilitySettings (reducedMotion, highContrast, largeTouchTargets, screenReader), AudioSettings (sfxVolume, musicEnabled, hapticIntensity), DataSettings (exportData, importData). Implement context provider with AsyncStorage persistence using the existing AsyncStorageAdapter pattern from SaveManager. Include default settings values, validation logic, and methods to connect with the existing SettingsScreen.tsx and SettingsModal.tsx components.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Pattern Suggestions Setting Fully Integrated

The Pattern Suggestions toggle in Settings is now fully connected to the actual pattern detection system through comprehensive state management integration. Key implementation achievements:

1. **Context Integration**: PatternSuggestionContext now subscribes to SettingsContext and dynamically responds to patternSuggestionsEnabled setting changes.

2. **Real-time State Management**: When disabled, system immediately clears all active suggestions, resets pattern count to 0, and closes any open suggestion popups. When re-enabled, automatically recalculates suggestions based on current beacon positions.

3. **Performance Optimization**: All pattern detection calculations now include a setting check before processing, preventing unnecessary computation when suggestions are disabled.

4. **Persistence & Immediate Application**: Setting persists across app sessions via AsyncStorage and applies instantly without requiring app restart, providing seamless user experience.

5. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup implemented to prevent memory leaks or stale suggestion data when toggling between enabled/disabled states.

The placeholder alert has been completely replaced with actual functional integration, establishing a robust connection between the settings UI and the pattern detection system that maintains performance while providing responsive user control.
