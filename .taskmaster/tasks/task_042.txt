# Task ID: 42
# Title: Create Stellar Reignition Cascade Events System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 29, 38
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement backend cascade events system that triggers when beacon density reaches threshold in dying sectors, focusing on cascade logic, resource calculations, and state persistence without any UI components.
# Details:
Create CascadeEventManager class to handle stellar reignition backend mechanics: 1) **Threshold Detection System**: Monitor beacon density per sector using spatial analysis algorithms, trigger cascade when beacon count reaches 8+ beacons within dying sector boundaries. Integrate with Task 26's GalaxySectorManager to identify dying sectors and calculate beacon coverage using efficient spatial indexing. 2) **Cascade Trigger Logic**: Implement cascade initiation logic when threshold conditions are met, checking for adjacent dying sectors within 2-sector radius for potential chain reactions. Use breadth-first search algorithm to identify cascade propagation paths and calculate chain reaction sequences. 3) **Resource Bonus Calculation System**: Apply permanent sector bonuses to revived areas through backend calculations: +50% Stellar Essence generation multiplier for all beacons in revived sectors, +25% base Quantum Data generation bonus, procedural generation of rare Chronos Particle deposits (1-3 particles per revived sector based on sector size and beacon density). 4) **State Persistence System**: Store revived sector states in save system for persistence across sessions, maintain cascade event history with timestamps and affected sectors, implement efficient data structures for fast lookup of revived sector bonuses during resource calculations. 5) **Achievement Integration Backend**: Create cascade event history tracking system for achievement milestone calculation, implement counters for total sectors revived, largest cascade chain length, and total Chronos Particles earned from cascades.

# Test Strategy:
Test beacon density threshold detection algorithms by creating mock sectors with exactly 8 beacons and verifying cascade trigger logic activates correctly. Validate cascade propagation algorithms by creating chains of dying sectors with adequate beacon coverage, confirming breadth-first search correctly identifies all affected sectors in chain reactions. Test resource bonus calculation accuracy by verifying +50% Stellar Essence and +25% Quantum Data multipliers apply correctly to affected beacons and persist through save/load cycles. Validate Chronos Particle generation algorithms ensuring 1-3 particles generate per sector based on documented rules. Test state persistence by triggering cascades, restarting application, and confirming revived sector bonuses remain active. Validate achievement integration by verifying cascade event counters increment correctly and milestone calculations trigger at appropriate thresholds.
