# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Quantum Leap Prestige System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the complete prestige mechanic backend allowing players to reset their beacon network for permanent meta-progression bonuses, Echo Beacon spawning, and decay resistance improvements through pure business logic and data processing systems.
# Details:
Develop backend QuantumLeapManager class with full reset and progression system: 1) **Reset Mechanics**: Implement resetNetwork() method that clears all beacons, probes, and accumulated resources while preserving meta-progression currencies in game state. Store pattern analysis before reset using existing PatternAnalyzer to identify strong geometric formations (triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons) and their beacon positions for Echo Beacon placement data. 2) **Echo Beacon System**: Create EchoBeacon class extending Beacon with enhanced backend properties: higher starting levels (2-5 based on pattern strength), improved generation rates (+50% base), and metadata for visual distinction. Implement spawnEchoBeacons() method that calculates Echo Beacon placement at previous strong pattern locations with level scaling: Triangle patterns spawn level 2, Square level 3, Pentagon level 4, Hexagon level 5. 3) **Meta-Progression Currency**: Add QuantumResonance currency calculation based on total beacons at reset (1 per 10 beacons). Create MetaUpgradeManager with permanent bonus calculations: Decay Resistance (reduces entropy spread rate by 10% per level), Network Efficiency (+5% resource generation per level), Pattern Mastery (+10% pattern bonus multiplier per level), Probe Acceleration (+15% launch speed per level). 4) **Leap Counter and Milestones**: Track totalQuantumLeaps with backend milestone reward system at leaps 1, 3, 7, 15, 30 unlocking exclusive meta-upgrades and effect modifiers. 5) **Save System Integration**: Ensure all meta-progression data persists across app sessions with proper serialization and deserialization of QuantumLeapManager state, MetaUpgradeManager bonuses, and Echo Beacon spawn data.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete backend reset functionality ensuring all game state clears except meta-progression data structures. Verify Echo Beacon placement calculation accuracy at previous pattern locations with correct level scaling algorithms. Test QuantumResonance calculation logic based on beacon count at reset. Validate meta-upgrade purchase logic and permanent effect calculations across resets. Test decay resistance mechanics with entropy spread rate reduction calculations. Verify save system integration ensuring meta-progression data persists between app sessions. Performance testing with multiple leap calculations and large Echo Beacon spawning datasets. Integration testing with existing PatternAnalyzer and ResourceManager systems.
