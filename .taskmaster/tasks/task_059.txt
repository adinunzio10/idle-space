# Task ID: 59
# Title: Create Quantum Leap Prestige System UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 29, 41, 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement comprehensive frontend components for the prestige reset system including confirmation dialogs, progression screens, echo beacon visualizations, particle effects, and milestone tracking displays using React Native and NativeWind styling.
# Details:
Create QuantumLeapUI component suite with the following elements: 1) **Quantum Leap Confirmation Dialog**: Implement modal dialog using react-native-modal with dark space theme styling, featuring current progress preview (total beacons, patterns discovered, resources accumulated), leap benefits calculation display, and confirmation/cancel buttons with haptic feedback. Include QuantumLeapPreview component showing post-leap benefits and permanent upgrades. 2) **MetaProgressionScreen**: Create full-screen component displaying available Echo Beacon upgrades in grid layout, leap history timeline with dates and benefits gained, permanent multiplier displays, and next milestone progress bars. Use ScrollView with lazy loading for performance. 3) **Echo Beacon Placement Preview**: Implement EchoBeaconVisualizer component using react-native-svg to show translucent beacon overlays on galaxy map, connection range indicators with animated pulses, and placement validation feedback. Integrate with existing galaxy map coordinate system. 4) **Quantum Particle Effects**: Create QuantumLeapEffectManager using react-native-reanimated for activation animations including particle burst effects on leap trigger, screen-wide quantum energy waves, beacon transformation animations, and progress counter reset animations. 5) **Milestone Progress Tracking**: Implement ProgressMilestoneDisplay components with animated progress bars, achievement unlock notifications, and visual feedback for milestone completion. Use consistent NativeWind styling with bg-surface, text-primary, and accent colors. Ensure responsive design for various device sizes and portrait orientation optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test quantum leap confirmation dialog by simulating various game states and verifying accurate progress calculations and benefit previews display correctly. Validate MetaProgressionScreen performance with large datasets of leap history and multiple Echo Beacon upgrades, ensuring smooth scrolling and lazy loading functionality. Test Echo Beacon placement preview accuracy by comparing overlay positions with actual galaxy map coordinates and verifying visual feedback for valid/invalid placements. Verify quantum particle effects performance across different device specifications, ensuring 60fps animation during leap activation without blocking UI responsiveness. Test milestone progress displays with simulated progress changes and achievement triggers, confirming animations complete smoothly and notifications appear correctly. Validate responsive design across device sizes and orientations, ensuring one-handed usability and proper safe area handling. Test integration with existing UI architecture and navigation flows.
