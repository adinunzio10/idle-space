# Task ID: 45
# Title: Implement Hierarchical Pattern Discovery System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform the basic geometric pattern system into a hierarchical discovery system with complex multi-shape configurations, emergent patterns, and progressive complexity tiers to provide months of discovery content.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive hierarchical pattern system backend that builds upon existing basic shapes: 1) **Pattern Definition System**: Implement ComplexPattern interface with geometric requirements, scale variations, specialization dependencies, proximity rules, and exclusivity conditions. Create PatternRequirement structure defining shape arrangements, beacon specializations, and connection rules. 2) **Enhanced Detection Algorithm**: Extend existing PatternDetector to handle multi-shape configurations using spatial indexing and hierarchical matching. Implement real-time detection with partial progress tracking for complex patterns spanning 10-50+ beacons. Add conflict resolution for overlapping pattern possibilities. 3) **Pattern Tiers Implementation**: Create backend logic for Tier 1 Enhanced Basic Patterns (Solar Ring: pentagon + 5 triangles, Quantum Core: square + corner triangles, Stellar Crown: hexagon + alternating perimeter shapes), Tier 2 Network Formations (Quantum Lattice: interconnected square grids, Stellar Cascade: fibonacci triangle chains, Resonance Web: complex multi-shape networks), Tier 3 Architectural Marvels (Galaxy Heart: 50+ beacon formations, Cosmic Mandala: symmetrical specialized patterns). 4) **Discovery System Backend**: Implement progressive pattern unlocking logic based on basic shape mastery, context-aware suggestion algorithms for complex patterns, discovery state management with completion tracking. 5) **Data Structures**: Create PatternDatabase with flexible pattern definitions and conflict resolution, DiscoveryTracker for completion state management, and HierarchicalBonus calculator for multiplicative pattern interactions. 6) **Performance Optimization**: Implement spatial partitioning for efficient large-network scanning, background pattern detection algorithms optimized for performance, and incremental validation systems to maintain detection efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive backend testing across all pattern systems: 1) **Pattern Detection Logic**: Test detection algorithms for all 30+ complex patterns with various beacon arrangements, verify partial progress calculation algorithms for incomplete patterns, test pattern prioritization logic when multiple configurations possible. 2) **Performance Validation**: Measure pattern detection algorithm performance with 500+ beacon networks maintaining <16ms scanning time, verify memory usage of spatial indexing stays under 20MB additional overhead, test background detection algorithm efficiency. 3) **Discovery Progression Logic**: Verify basic shape completion triggers Tier 1 pattern unlocking, test suggestion algorithm provides appropriate pattern hints, validate discovery state persistence and completion tracking. 4) **Business Logic Integration**: Test pattern bonus calculation algorithms integrate properly with resource generation systems, verify discovered pattern data persists across save/load cycles, test hierarchical bonus calculations with multiplicative stacking. 5) **Algorithm Accuracy**: Test spatial partitioning accuracy for large beacon networks, verify conflict resolution algorithms handle overlapping pattern possibilities correctly, validate incremental detection maintains accuracy during network changes.
