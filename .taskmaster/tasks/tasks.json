Fixed getQualitySettings() worklet violation (Line 532): Replaced hook-based getQualitySettings() call with direct performanceMonitor.getQualitySettings() access in StarField component props, avoiding non-worklet function calls inside useAnimatedStyle.\n\n3. Updated singleTapGesture.onEnd(): Modified to pass all necessary state data (viewportState.bounds, renderingState.clusters, renderingState.connections, renderingState.visibleBeacons) as parameters to runOnJS(handleSingleTap), maintaining proper worklet boundaries.\n\n4. Removed unused runOnUI import to clean up linting warnings.\n\nAll gesture handlers now properly use runOnJS() for JavaScript function calls, and worklet boundaries are correctly maintained. No more synchronous UI thread to JavaScript thread violations. TypeScript compilation and ESLint validation both pass without errors or warnings.

Replace Map objects with plain objects or arrays in SharedValue contexts. Implement serialization validation for SharedValue assignments. Add runtime checks to prevent non-serializable data from crossing worklet boundaries.\n<info added on 2025-08-24T01:51:48.724Z>\n**Implementation Completed:**\n\nSuccessfully resolved SharedValue serialization issues that were causing JSI crashes at worklet boundaries. Key fixes implemented:\n\n1. **Gesture State Refactoring**: Replaced complex gestureState object with individual primitive SharedValues (isActive, scale, translateX, translateY) to ensure worklet serialization compatibility.\n\n2. **Touch Tracking Serialization**: Converted activeTouchAreas from Map object to JSON string storage in SharedValue, preventing non-serializable object crossing worklet boundaries.\n\n3. **Data Structure Migration**: Eliminated all Map and Set objects from SharedValue contexts, replacing with primitive values and serializable alternatives.\n\n4. **Runtime Validation**: Added serialization checks to prevent future violations when assigning complex objects to SharedValues.\n\nThese changes directly address the facebook::jsi::Function::getHostFunction crash by ensuring all data crossing worklet boundaries is properly serializable. The galaxy map gesture handling should now operate without JSI crashes during pan, zoom, and touch interactions.\n</info added on 2025-08-24T01:51:48.724Z>",
