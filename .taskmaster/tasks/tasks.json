Investigation steps: 1) **Identify Circular Dependencies**: Audit all useEffect hooks in GalaxyMapModular for missing dependency arrays or dependencies that change on every render (objects/arrays recreated each render, inline function definitions). Common culprits include viewport calculations, gesture handlers, or beacon filtering logic. 2) **Memoization Strategy**: Implement useMemo for expensive computations like visible beacon filtering, connection calculations, and viewport transformations. Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components. 3) **State Update Analysis**: Review all setState calls within useEffect hooks - ensure they have proper conditional guards to prevent infinite loops. Check for state updates that immediately trigger the same effect again. 4) **Ref-based Solutions**: Replace state with useRef for values that don't need to trigger re-renders (animation values, previous viewport positions, gesture state). 5) **Context Optimization**: If using contexts (GameContext, ResourceContext), ensure context values are memoized to prevent unnecessary consumer re-renders. 6) **Component Splitting**: Consider breaking GalaxyMapModular into smaller sub-components with React.memo to isolate re-render boundaries. 7) **Gesture Handler Review**: Based on previous gesture-related issues (Tasks 11, 14), ensure React Native Gesture Handler worklets aren't triggering JavaScript state updates without runOnJS wrapper.",

Set up test environment configuration to enable Reanimated warnings in test mode while suppressing other debug output. 2) **Worklet Object Tracking Tests**: Build test utilities that monitor object references passed to worklets, creating snapshots of object states before and after worklet execution. Implement property change detection that identifies when worklet-bound objects are modified outside the worklet context. Create mock worklet environments for testing object immutability patterns. 3) **Component-Specific Mutation Tests**: Design targeted test cases for beacon rendering components (BeaconRenderer, VisualDecayEffects, EntropyVisualization) that validate proper object cloning before worklet usage. Test gesture handler implementations to ensure shared values and animated objects maintain immutability. Create regression tests that simulate the exact mutation patterns identified in the 240 warning instances. 4) **Continuous Monitoring Infrastructure**: Implement test reporters that track warning counts and categorize mutation types across test runs. Set up CI/CD integration that fails builds when new Reanimated object mutations are introduced. Create performance benchmarks to ensure object cloning strategies don't impact animation performance. 5) **Development Tooling**: Build development-time warning aggregators that collect and analyze Reanimated warnings during local development.
