Investigate PatternSuggestionContext state synchronization with UI components. Verify event handlers are properly connected after context migration. 2) **Pentagon Detection Consistency**: Debug 4th beacon placement not reliably triggering pentagon suggestions. Review pattern detection logic in PatternDetector class for geometric validation edge cases. Implement more robust beacon position validation and angle tolerance calculations. 3) **Pattern Count Display Issues**: Fix inconsistent count display (alternating between 1 and 2 for same configuration). Investigate race conditions in pattern calculation updates and ensure single source of truth from PatternSuggestionContext. Add debouncing to prevent rapid state updates. 4) **Map Overlay Visualization Breakdown**: Completely rebuild PatternSuggestionOverlay integration with new context system. Fix dotted pattern lines not rendering by ensuring SVG overlay components receive proper pattern data from context. Verify React Native SVG compatibility with new state management approach. 5) **State Management Audit**: Thoroughly review PatternSuggestionContext implementation for proper state initialization, update mechanisms, and component subscription patterns. Ensure context providers wrap all dependent components correctly. Add comprehensive logging for pattern state transitions to identify root causes. Use React DevTools Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks and unnecessary re-renders.",

Test with overlapping pattern configurations. 4) Enable pattern overlay toggle and verify dotted lines render correctly for all detected patterns (triangles through hexagons).
