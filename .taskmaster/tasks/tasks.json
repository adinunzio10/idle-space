Use react-native-svg for scalable star rendering with animated pulsing for dying stars. 2) **Sector System Implementation**: Create SectorManager to divide galaxy into logical regions using Voronoi diagrams or hexagonal grid system. Implement SectorBoundary component with subtle line rendering (#6B7280, 0.3 opacity) that become visible at zoom levels >0.3x. Add entropy level visualization per sector using background color tinting from blue (low entropy) to red (high entropy). 3) **Entropy Decay System**: Implement EntropySpreadManager using cellular automata principles where entropy spreads from high-entropy sectors to adjacent low-entropy sectors over time. Create visual decay effects using particle systems or animated gradients showing entropy creeping between sector boundaries. Add time-based decay simulation that affects star system states over gameplay sessions. 4) **Interactive Overlays**: Create HarvestOverlay component that highlights harvestable resources when players zoom beyond 0.5x. Implement ResourceIndicator showing dying stars with Stellar Essence amounts and dead systems with Void Fragment potential. Add touch/tap interactions for resource collection with visual feedback and state updates. 5) **Performance Optimization**: Implement level-of-detail rendering where star systems render as points at low zoom, detailed sprites at medium zoom, and full animated components at high zoom. Use spatial indexing (R-tree) for efficient sector and star system culling. Implement virtualization for off-screen star systems to maintain 60fps with thousands of systems. 6) **Integration with Existing Systems**: Extend GalaxyMapView to include StarSystemRenderer and SectorRenderer as background layers beneath existing beacon rendering.
