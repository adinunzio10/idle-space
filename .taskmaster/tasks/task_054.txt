# Task ID: 54
# Title: Create Comprehensive Testing Suite for GalaxyMapModular Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 53
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop automated tests to validate the fixes applied to GalaxyMapModular component and prevent future maximum update depth errors through regression testing.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive testing suite for the GalaxyMapModular component based on the investigation findings from task 53. Implement the following test categories: 1) **Circular Dependency Prevention Tests**: Create tests that verify useEffect dependencies are properly managed and don't trigger infinite loops. Mock React's render cycle to detect when component enters infinite re-render state. Test state/ref synchronization patterns to ensure setGestureActiveState and setEmergencyModeState wrappers function correctly without causing loops. 2) **Memory Leak Detection Tests**: Implement tests using @testing-library/react-native to verify proper cleanup of timeouts, intervals, and event subscriptions. Test component mount/unmount cycles to ensure notificationTimeouts ref properly clears all setTimeout IDs. Verify eventBusUnsubscribe cleanup prevents memory leaks from module event subscriptions. 3) **Performance Regression Tests**: Create performance tests that monitor FPS update frequency and ensure state guards prevent unnecessary re-renders. Test moduleContext memoization effectiveness with stable references for beacons, connections, and other array props. Validate gesture handler throttling mechanisms work correctly under rapid interaction. 4) **State Management Validation**: Test that moduleElements useMemo remains pure without side effects after the critical fix removing state updates. Verify cachedModuleRender updates occur in separate useEffect rather than inside computation hooks. Test emergency mode detection and performance monitoring integration. 5) **Integration Tests**: Create integration tests that simulate real user interactions including pan/zoom gestures, beacon placement, and module initialization. Test component behavior under high stress conditions with multiple simultaneous state updates. Use React Testing Library to verify component renders without throwing maximum update depth errors.

# Test Strategy:
Implement test suite using Jest and React Native Testing Library with the following verification steps: 1) Create mock implementations of ModuleManager, gesture handlers, and performance monitoring systems. 2) Test circular dependency prevention by simulating rapid state changes and verifying no infinite loops occur. 3) Use cleanup verification tests that check all timeouts and subscriptions are properly cleared after unmount. 4) Implement performance regression tests that measure render frequency and state update patterns. 5) Create integration tests that exercise full component lifecycle with realistic user interactions. 6) Add automated tests to CI pipeline to prevent regression of maximum update depth errors. 7) Use React DevTools Profiler simulation to validate rendering performance improvements. 8) Test memory usage patterns to ensure optimizations don't introduce new leaks.

## 2. Create Circular Dependency Prevention Test Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 54.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive tests to detect and prevent infinite re-render loops in GalaxyMapModular component, focusing on useEffect dependencies and state synchronization patterns that could trigger maximum update depth errors.
### Details:
Create test file GalaxyMapModular.circular-deps.test.tsx. Mock React's render cycle using jest.spyOn on React.useState and React.useEffect to track state updates and effect executions. Implement test cases that simulate rapid prop changes (beacons, connections, viewport updates) and verify component doesn't enter infinite loops. Test setGestureActiveState and setEmergencyModeState wrapper functions to ensure they don't cause circular updates. Create mock scenarios where moduleContext changes rapidly and verify component handles it gracefully without exceeding React's maximum update depth limit. Add performance monitoring mock to detect when component attempts more than 50 consecutive renders.
<info added on 2025-09-04T16:52:45.065Z>
Test suite implementation completed with 17 comprehensive test cases covering all critical areas: basic rendering stability, performance mode validation, module system integration, hook usage monitoring, maximum update depth error detection, and regression testing for Task 53 fixes including state/ref synchronization wrappers, memoization strategies, and performance metrics guards. Integration stability tests validate component behavior under various data loads and proper cleanup during unmounting. All test cases pass successfully, confirming the circular dependency prevention measures from Task 53 are working effectively and the component is now stable against infinite render loops.

## 3. Implement Memory Leak Detection Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 54.1
### Description: Create automated tests to verify proper cleanup of timeouts, intervals, and event subscriptions in GalaxyMapModular component, ensuring no memory leaks during component mount/unmount cycles.
### Details:
Create test file GalaxyMapModular.memory-leaks.test.tsx. Mock setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout, and clearInterval using jest.useFakeTimers(). Test component mount/unmount cycles by rendering and unmounting component multiple times, tracking active timeouts and intervals. Verify notificationTimeouts ref properly clears all timeout IDs on unmount using spy functions. Mock ModuleManager and eventBus to track subscription/unsubscription calls, ensuring eventBusUnsubscribe cleanup prevents memory leaks. Create test scenarios with performance monitoring timers and gesture-related timeouts to verify they're properly cleaned up. Implement memory usage tracking using jsdom-global and verify no accumulated references after component unmount.

Implementation completed successfully. Test suite contains 25 comprehensive test cases covering component lifecycle validation, timer management with creation/cleanup tracking, event subscription cleanup for module integrations, performance monitoring cleanup, stress testing under rapid prop changes, and state/ref cleanup verification. Includes specific regression tests for Task 53 fixes: notification timeout cleanup, event bus subscription cleanup, performance monitoring cleanup, and comprehensive memory leak prevention. All tests pass, confirming proper resource cleanup and no memory leaks.

## 4. Create Performance Regression Test Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 54.1
### Description: Develop performance-focused tests that monitor FPS update frequency, validate state guards prevent unnecessary re-renders, and verify optimization mechanisms work correctly under various load conditions.
### Details:
Create test file GalaxyMapModular.performance.test.tsx. Mock performance.now() and Date.now() to control timing in tests. Implement tests that track moduleContext memoization effectiveness by counting recreation events with stable vs changing props. Verify gesture handler throttling by simulating rapid pan/pinch events and ensuring viewport updates are properly throttled (max 1 per 50ms during gestures). Test shouldSkipFrame functionality by mocking galaxyMapConfig.shouldSkipFrame() and verifying cached renders are used when frame skipping is active. Create load testing scenarios with 100+ beacons and verify component maintains stable performance metrics. Mock FPS calculation and verify emergency mode triggers correctly when FPS drops below 15.

Implement test scenarios that simulate complete user workflows: component initialization → module loading → gesture interactions → beacon selection → viewport updates. Test component behavior under high stress with simultaneous state updates by firing multiple gesture events, prop changes, and module notifications concurrently. Verify maximum update depth errors never occur during realistic user interactions by wrapping component in React error boundaries and asserting no errors. Mock ModuleManager, BeaconRenderingModule, and other dependencies to test integration points. Create end-to-end scenarios testing emergency mode recovery and performance dashboard interactions.
