# Task ID: 45
# Title: Implement Hierarchical Pattern Discovery System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform the basic geometric pattern system into a hierarchical discovery system with complex multi-shape configurations, emergent patterns, and progressive complexity tiers to provide months of discovery content.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive hierarchical pattern system that builds upon existing basic shapes: 1) **Pattern Definition System**: Implement ComplexPattern interface with geometric requirements, scale variations, specialization dependencies, proximity rules, and exclusivity conditions. Create PatternRequirement structure defining shape arrangements, beacon specializations, and connection rules. 2) **Enhanced Detection Algorithm**: Extend existing PatternDetector to handle multi-shape configurations using spatial indexing and hierarchical matching. Implement real-time detection with partial progress tracking for complex patterns spanning 10-50+ beacons. Add conflict resolution for overlapping pattern possibilities. 3) **Pattern Tiers Implementation**: Create Tier 1 Enhanced Basic Patterns (Solar Ring: pentagon + 5 triangles, Quantum Core: square + corner triangles, Stellar Crown: hexagon + alternating perimeter shapes), Tier 2 Network Formations (Quantum Lattice: interconnected square grids, Stellar Cascade: fibonacci triangle chains, Resonance Web: complex multi-shape networks), Tier 3 Architectural Marvels (Galaxy Heart: 50+ beacon formations, Cosmic Mandala: symmetrical specialized patterns). 4) **Discovery System Integration**: Implement progressive pattern unlocking based on basic shape mastery, context-aware suggestion system for complex patterns, discovery celebration with visual effects and Resonance Crystal rewards. 5) **Data Structures**: Create PatternDatabase with flexible pattern definitions, DiscoveryTracker for completion state, and HierarchicalBonus calculator for multiplicative pattern interactions. 6) **Performance Optimization**: Implement spatial partitioning for efficient large-network scanning, background pattern detection with battery optimization, and incremental validation to maintain 60fps target.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing across all pattern tiers: 1) **Pattern Detection Accuracy**: Test detection of all 30+ complex patterns with various beacon arrangements, verify partial progress calculation for incomplete patterns, test pattern prioritization when multiple configurations possible. 2) **Performance Validation**: Measure pattern detection performance with 500+ beacon networks maintaining <16ms scanning time, verify memory usage stays under 20MB additional overhead, test battery impact during background detection. 3) **Discovery Progression**: Verify basic shapes unlock Tier 1 patterns, test suggestion system provides appropriate hints without spoiling discovery, validate discovery celebration triggers correctly. 4) **Integration Testing**: Test pattern bonus calculations integrate properly with resource generation, verify discovered patterns persist across save/load cycles, test pattern library displays all discovered configurations with correct metadata. 5) **User Experience**: Test tutorial progression introduces complexity gradually, verify hint system remains valuable long-term, validate discovery satisfaction balance with guidance assistance.
