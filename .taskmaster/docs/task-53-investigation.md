# Task 53 Investigation: Fix Maximum Update Depth Error in GalaxyMapModular

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: 53
- **Title**: Fix Maximum Update Depth Error in GalaxyMapModular Component
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Complexity**: 8/10
- **Dependencies**: 11, 14, 15

## Problem Description
Resolve the critical React maximum update depth exceeded error in GalaxyMapModular caused by infinite render loops from improper useEffect dependencies or state updates triggering continuous re-renders. Error occurs at line 65 of GalaxyMapModular.tsx.

## Investigation Progress

### Phase 1: Initial Code Examination
**Status**: Completed
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-04

#### Actions Taken:
1. Retrieved task details from task-master
2. Created this investigation document
3. Examined GalaxyMapModular.tsx file (759 lines)

#### Findings:
- [x] Initial code review completed
- [x] Error location identification - line 65 is the component definition, not the source
- [x] useEffect dependency analysis - Multiple potential circular dependency issues identified

#### Critical Issues Identified:

1. **Circular useEffect Dependencies (Multiple locations)**:
   - Line 97-99: `isGestureActiveRef.current = isGestureActive` triggers on every isGestureActive change
   - Line 127-129: Similar pattern with `emergencyModeRef.current = emergencyMode`
   - Line 338-382: Complex useEffect with pending viewport updates that could cause infinite loops
   - Line 432-436: Module cache update effect that depends on moduleElements

2. **Problematic useCallback/useMemo Dependencies**:
   - Line 282: `updatePerformanceMetrics` has empty dependency array but accesses `emergencyModeRef.current`
   - Line 334: `updateViewportState` removed `isGestureActive` from deps but still uses it via ref
   - Line 400: `moduleContext` recreated on every prop change, could trigger module re-renders
   - Line 429: `moduleElements` depends on `moduleContext` which changes frequently

3. **State Updates in Effects**:
   - Line 158-164: Performance monitoring interval that calls `updatePerformanceMetrics`
   - Line 216-228: Notification state updates within module initialization
   - Line 374: `setCachedModuleRender` called within InteractionManager callback
   - Line 434: `setCachedModuleRender` in useEffect depending on `moduleElements`

4. **Potential Memory Leaks**:
   - Module event bus subscriptions without cleanup
   - Performance monitoring interval (cleared but created frequently)
   - Notification auto-dismiss timeouts

### Phase 2: Dependency Analysis
**Status**: Completed
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-04

#### Actions Taken:
1. Fixed circular useEffect dependencies for isGestureActive and emergencyMode state syncing
2. Replaced useEffect patterns with useCallback wrapper functions 
3. Fixed complex viewport update effect circular dependency
4. Eliminated setCachedModuleRender circular dependency in module rendering

#### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **State/Ref Sync Pattern Replacement**:
   - Removed `useEffect(() => { isGestureActiveRef.current = isGestureActive }, [isGestureActive])`
   - Removed `useEffect(() => { emergencyModeRef.current = emergencyMode }, [emergencyMode])`
   - Added `setGestureActiveState()` and `setEmergencyModeState()` wrapper functions
   - Updated all state setters to use wrapper functions

2. **Viewport Update Effect Fix**:
   - Replaced `updateViewportState` call in useEffect with direct state management
   - Added proper dependency array `[isGestureActive, width, height]`
   - Moved viewport calculations inline to avoid function call loops

3. **Module Cache Circular Dependency Fix**:
   - Removed separate useEffect for `setCachedModuleRender`
   - Added `updateModuleCache` callback that checks `isGestureActiveRef` directly
   - Cache is now updated immediately during render without triggering additional effects
   - Added `moduleElementsRef` to track cache state without causing re-renders

#### Results:
- [x] Circular useEffect dependencies eliminated
- [x] State/ref synchronization patterns optimized  
- [x] Complex viewport update loop resolved
- [x] Module rendering cache dependency cycle broken

#### Areas to Investigate:
- [ ] useEffect hooks with missing or problematic dependency arrays
- [ ] State updates within useEffect causing infinite loops
- [ ] Object/array recreations on each render
- [ ] Inline function definitions in dependencies

### Phase 3: Memoization Strategy
**Status**: Completed
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-04

#### Actions Taken:
1. Implemented comprehensive memoization for moduleContext creation
2. Added stable references for all array props to prevent unnecessary re-computations
3. Fixed event bus subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks
4. Optimized screen dimensions memoization

#### Key Optimizations Applied:

1. **ModuleContext Optimization**:
   - Added `screenDimensions` memoization with `useMemo(() => ({ width, height }), [width, height])`
   - Created stable references for all array props: `stableBeacons`, `stableConnections`, etc.
   - Reduced moduleContext recreation frequency by using stable references in dependencies

2. **Memory Leak Prevention**:
   - Added `eventBusUnsubscribe` ref to properly track event bus subscriptions
   - Implemented cleanup in both component unmount and module re-initialization
   - Fixed unsubscribe function storage without adding properties to ModuleManager

3. **Performance Callback Optimization**:
   - `updatePerformanceMetrics` already properly memoized with empty dependency array
   - `dismissNotification` already optimized with useCallback
   - `handleTapInteraction` already has proper dependency management

4. **Module Cache Optimization**:
   - Replaced circular dependency useEffect with direct cache update in render
   - Used `updateModuleCache` callback that checks gesture state without causing loops
   - Added `moduleElementsRef` for additional cache tracking without re-renders

#### Results:
- [x] ModuleContext recreation frequency optimized
- [x] Memory leaks from event bus subscriptions eliminated
- [x] Stable references implemented for all array props
- [x] TypeScript errors resolved
- [x] Performance callback optimizations verified

#### Optimizations to Consider:
- [x] useMemo for expensive computations (beacon filtering, viewport calculations)
- [x] useCallback for event handlers  
- [x] Context value memoization
- [ ] Component splitting with React.memo (deferred - current component performs well)

### Phase 4: State Update Patterns and Performance Metrics
**Status**: Completed  
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-04

#### Actions Taken:
1. Implemented proper notification timeout management to prevent memory leaks
2. Added state guards for FPS updates to reduce unnecessary state changes
3. Created comprehensive cleanup system for all timeouts and subscriptions
4. Optimized callback dependencies and moved functions to proper order

#### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Notification System Optimization**:
   - Added `notificationTimeouts` ref to track all setTimeout IDs
   - Created `addNotification` and `dismissNotification` callbacks with proper cleanup
   - Replaced inline setTimeout with tracked timeout management
   - Added timeout cleanup on component unmount and notification dismissal

2. **FPS Update State Guards**:
   - Changed `setFps(Math.round(newFps))` to `setFps(prev => prev !== roundedFps ? roundedFps : prev)`
   - Prevents unnecessary state updates when FPS hasn't changed
   - Reduces render cycles triggered by performance monitoring

3. **Function Order and Dependencies**:
   - Moved notification management functions before module initialization useEffect
   - Added proper dependency arrays without circular dependencies
   - Fixed TypeScript errors by ensuring proper function declaration order

4. **Comprehensive Cleanup**:
   - All timeouts are cleared on component unmount
   - Event bus subscriptions properly cleaned up
   - No memory leaks from pending notifications or intervals

#### Results:
- [x] Notification timeout memory leaks eliminated
- [x] FPS state update frequency reduced with guards
- [x] All function dependencies properly ordered
- [x] TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [x] Comprehensive cleanup implemented for unmount
